  Cellular membranes are complex systems that are hard to study both experimentally and theoretically. Classical molecular dynamics simulations (MD)
give detailed information about membrane structure, dynamics and its interactions with other biomolecules. However,  there is still a room for
improvements in the current force fields, especially in the hydrophilic region of membrane.  According to the results reported in NMRlipids, Open Collaboration project
running at nmrlipids.blogspot.fi, biologically relevant Na+ and Ca2+ generally overbind to zwitterionic phophatidylcholine (PC) membranes in current MD models [Ollila 2016].
Here we suggest that the PC lipid membrane-ion interactions can be corrected by implicitly inducing electronic polarizability in the lipid models by
using a simple electrostatic continuum correction (ECC) for partial charges [Leontyev 2010], which is successfully applied already to monovalent and divalent ions in bulk water [Kohagen, 2015].
Our results show that applying ECC to existing force fields significantly improved PC lipid--cation interactions when compared against NMR data
by using the electrometer concept [Ollila 2016,Seelig87]. However, also other force field parameters have to be made consistent
for ECC correction to preserve the area per molecule and other relevant bilayer properties. This work is carried as Open Collaboration
in NMRlipids VI project (http://nmrlipids.blogspot.fi).

\section{Introduction}

Cations were shown to generally overbind in PC lipid bilayers in
NMRlipids II project. Here we propose that the cation overbinding can
be corrected by implicitly inducing electronic polarizability in
lipid headgroups by scaling the partial charges.

\section{Effect of scaling of headgroup and glycerol backbone partial charges on lipid bilayer properties and cation binding}

Headgroup and glycerol backbone partial charges of Slipids and Lipid14 models were scaled
with various scaling factors and cation binding was monitored by using the electrometer
concept. Headgroup order parameter changes as a function of ion concentration are
shown in Fig. \ref{OrderParameterIONSchangesSCALED}. The order parameter decrease
seemst to be proportional to the headgroup charges: the smaller the charges
(larger scaling factor), the less change is observed in order parameters.
According to the electrometer concept, this means that the headgroup scaling
decreases cation binding affinity. However, from this data only we cannot
exclude the possibility that order parameters are changing less because
headgroup becomes less sensitive for cation binding.

  \caption{\label{OrderParameterIONSchangesSCALED}
    Headgroup order parameter changes as a function of cations from models
    with modified headgroup partial charges.}
\end{figure}

The best models from Fig.  \ref{OrderParameterIONSchangesSCALED} are shown in
Fig. \ref{OrderParameterCHANGESnewMODELS}. Based on these results we choose
two models for more careful studies: Slipids and Lipid 14 models with headroup
and glycerol backbone partial charges scaled with 0.8 and 0.85, respectively.

  \includegraphics[width=9.0cm]{../Fig/OrderParameterCHANGESnewMODELS.eps}
  \caption{\label{OrderParameterCHANGESnewMODELS}
    Headgroup order parameter changes as a function of cations from models
    with modified headgroup partial charges.}
\end{figure}



While scaling seems to improve ion binding, it changes the lipid bilayer properties
without ions. The glycerol backbone and headgroup order parameters are plotted in
Fig \ref{HGopsNEWmodels.eps} for reference models and EEC models. The difference,
i.e. the effect of scaling on these parameters, is shown in Fig. \ref{HGopsNEWmodelsCHANGE}.
The area per lipid from different models are shown in Table \ref{apls}
The conclusion is that the charge scaling has only a marginal effect on
headgroup order parameters, while area per lipid is significantly decreased.
Area per lipid decrease is more pronounced in Lipid14 than in Slipids.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Area per lipid from different models for POPC without ions\label{apls} }
  \begin{tabular}{c c}
    model          & A (Ã…$^2$)    \\
    Lipid14 (literature)  & 65.6$\pm$ 0.5   \\
    Lipid14eec0.85 & 55.5      \\
    Slipids (literature T=303K)       & 64.6 $\pm$ 0.4   \\
    SlipidsEEC0.8  & 57.8  \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The Calcium densities from new models and standard models are compared in Fig \ref{CAdensities}.
It seems to me that Ca binding in Lipid14 model is not reduced by scaling the
partial charges even thought the order parameter response is better.
On the other hand, in Slipids the binding seems to be reduced.
Possible interpretation is that Lipid14 result gets better because headgroup
gets less sensitive for bound charge, while in Slipid the binding is reduced.
