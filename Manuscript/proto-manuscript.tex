Classical molecular dynamics simulations give detailed information about membrane structure and dynamics. 
However, there is still a room for improvements in current force fields â€“ it is known from the literature,
that the binding of ions, especially cations, to phopholipid membranes is overestimated in all classical models [1]. 
We suggest that the membrane-ion interactions can be corrected by including implicit electronic polarizability into the
lipid models through the electronic continuum correction (ECC) [2], which was already applied to monovalent and divalent
ions yielding models that feature correct ion pairing [3]. 
Using the electrometer concept [3, 4] and x-ray scattering form factors, our simulations point out that our hypothesis is
correct and ECC is indeed a missing important contribution in current classical lipid models. 
Moreover, the solid physical principles behind ECC are found not to hamper other relevant properties of a phospholipid bilayer. 
The new lipid model, "ECC-lipids", shows accurate binding affinity to sodium and calcium cations and headgroup order parameter response to bound charge. 
We also provide for the first time a realistic stochiometry of bound calcium cations to a POPC membrane, and their binding sites. 
This work will continue as an open collaboration project NMRlipids VI (http://nmrlipids.blogspot.fi).

\section{Introduction}
Cation interactions with cellular membranes play a key role in several biological processes,
like in signal propagation in neurons and vesicle fusion.
Cation interactions with lipid bilayers serving as a model for cellular
membranes are thus widely studied with experimental \cite{cevc90,tocanne90,binder02,pabst07,uhrikova08}
and theoretical methods \cite{Berkowitz12,??}. General conclusion from experimental
studies has been that multivalent ions and lithium have weak specific binding in
phopholipid bilayers, while other monovalent ions do not essentially
bind \cite{cevc90,tocanne90,seelig90,binder02}. The presence of anoinic lipids, like PS or PG,
increase the concentration close to the bilayer and thus the amount of bound
ions, but do not affect the specific binding constant \cite{seelig90}.
The binding details, like binding sites and stoichiometry are not yet fully
resolved but interpretation of NMR and scattering experiments suggest that one
Ca2+ interacts mainly with the choline groups \cite{hauser76,hauser78,herbette84} of two
phospholipid molecules \cite{altenbach84}.

Classical molecular dynamics simulations have potential to solve the ion binding details
in lipid bilayers and reveal its relevance to various biological
problems \cite{bockmann03,bockmann04,??}. However, the available
molecular dynamics simulation models have a strong tendency to overestimate
cation binding on zwitterionic bilayers and none of them can reproduce the
experimental data with the accuracy required for the interpretation of
experiments \cite{catte16}. The overestimated specific cation binding also
makes zwitterionic bilayers effectively positively charged, which could
potentially lead to significant artefacts in applications.
Thus, there is a vast demand for classical molecular dynamics simulation
model which correctly reproduces cation binding in lipid bilayers. 

The lack of electronic polarizability from the classical MD simulation
models is a potential source of artefact, which could lead to overbinding
of cations. 
%Almost all lipid bilayer simulations reported in the literature 
%are done with force fields that represent interactions between atoms
%with pairwise additive empirical potential and exclude the electronic 
%polarizability \cite{SOME_review, FF_papers}.
The issue has been considered higly relevant since the early days of
lipid bilayer simulations and pioneering simulation studies scaled
the partial charges to effectively include electronic
polarizability \cite{jonsson86,egberts94}. The explicit inclusion of
electronic polarizability has been, however, turned to be 
practically complicated and implementations for lipids are rare \cite{chowdhary13}.

In this work we show that the cation overbinding in classical MD simulations
can be corrected by including electronic polarizability by using effective continuum
correction (ECC)~\cite{leontyev11} for polar region of zwitterionic lipid molecules.
This is essentially physicalle well justified version of partial charge scaling
implemented in early days of lipid and surfctant simulations \cite{jonsson86,egberts94}. 
The approach has been previously shown in to improve bulk performace of
ion models against neutron scattering data \cite{Jungwirth2015,kohagen14,kohagen16}.
The better bulk behaviour was not, however, sufficient to correct binding in lipid
bilayers \cite{catte16}. 
%motivation for its application to zwitterionic lipids like POPC.




\section{Methods}

\subsection{Electronic continuum correction for lipid bilayers}
According to the electronic continuum correction (ECC)\cite{leontyev11}, electronic
polarizability can be included in classical MD simulations by
placing all particles into a homogeneous dielectric continuum 
with a dielectric constant $\epsilon _{el}$, 
which is the electronic part of the dielectric constant of 
the media \cite{leontyev11}. Measurements of high frequency 
dielectric constant gives values of approximately $\epsilon _{el} \approx 2$ 
for almost any biomaterial \cite{some_original_work, leontyev11}. % that exists in living cells. 
Such a continuum can be easily included in standard MD simulation by
a formal transformation of partial charges 
\begin{equation}
  Q^{ECC} = f_q \cdot Q
\end{equation}
with a constant scaling factor $f_q = \epsilon _{el} ^{-1/2}$ 
effectively representing the newly introduced electronic continuum. 
The value measured for water, $\epsilon _{el} = 1.78$, gives 
a scaling factor of $f_q = 0.75$ \cite{some_orig_source, leontyev11}, which has been
successfully used to improve the performance of ion force fields \cite{kohagen14,kohagen16,??}. 

Here we apply the electronic continuum correction to lipid bilayers to accurately 
describe the lipid headgroup response to Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations \cite{catte16}. 
We use the Lipid14~\cite{dickson14} force field parameters as a starting point,
because they give the most realistic headgroup response with added cations 
and relatively realistic glycerol backbone and headgroup structures
when compared with other state of the art lipid models \cite{botan15,catte16}.
The partial atomic charges in Lipid14 were derived by fitting the electrostatic 
potential to its model quantum chemistry representation (RESP\cite{RESP_paper}) in vacuum.
If the charges are obtained by using RESP in an implicit solvent, 
they vary the most for the polar moieties \cite{maciejewski14}. 
In order to implicitly capture solvent induced polarization 
in models with fixed charges, 
we shall use the average of partial charges 
from both environments (i.e. vaccum and solvent),
so called implicitly polarized charges (IPolQ) \cite{ipolq2013}. 
By taking the charges of oxygen atoms in vacuum and implicit water solvent for POPC from \cite{maciejewski14}, 
we represent the IPolQ charges in the electronic continuum correction of the Lipid14 model
by increasing the scaling factor $f_q$ to $0.8$. 
\footnote{Depending on which QM method you arrive at values from 0.76 to 0.83, averages across atom types being around 0.78--0.80. Even though the methods are almost identical, authors of Lipid 14 find lower partial charges in vacuum than here -- so I prefer the higher value. As the choice of charges is arbitrary anyway, I use 0.80 as an approximate round value. The use of 0.78---.79 might be more appropriate, though.}

Hydrocarbon chains in Lipid14 and other lipids models are highly optimized and
give generally a good description for hydrophobic part of lipid bilayers
in various conditions \cite{ollila16},
in contrast to glycerol backbone and headgroup regions which require
some improvement in all available lipid models \cite{botan15}. 
To minimize the detuning of the highly optimized hydrocarbon
parameters, we apply ECC only
to the headgroup, glycerol backbone and carbonyl in acyl chains.
These regions are also the most polar parts in lipids and are expected
to most affect cation binding.   
%Because the biologically relevant cations like \ce{Na^+} and \ce{Ca^{2+}}
%are found to interact only with the phospholipid head group,
%and the accuracy of alkyl sidechains in Lipid14 model are satisfactory, 
%we exclude alkyl tails from our modifications. 

Mere scaling of partial charges in the modified region by the factor $f_q$ reduces the 
area per molecule to ??\todo{find the value}, which is significantly smaller than the
experimental value (\cite{}) and the original Lipid14 values (\cite{})\todo{Add the values}.  
The decrease of area was speculated 
\todo{SAMULI: Did you analyze the effect of this to hydration or did we only speculate?
JOE: I found a systematic decrease of water density in the heagroup region even if I kept APL constant.}
to arise from reduced hydration
of headgroup due to the lower polarity of molecules with scaled charges.
The hydration can be increased by decreasing the radius of atoms
by reducing the $\sigma$ parameters in Lennard-Jones potential for the selected atoms.
This allows water molecules to approach closer to lipid atoms and
have stonger electrostatic interactions with them.
\todo{SAMULI: This effect may have an official name. In that case we should mention it.}
Indeed, by reducing $\sigma$ with a scaling factor $f_\sigma = 0.89$ 
we increased the area per molecule
to a level close to experimental and original Lipid14 values. 
%\todo{Is there some justification for the below sentence?} 
%In line with the electronic continnum correction,
%the scaling factor for sigma parameters, $f_\sigma$,
%has to lay between $f_q$ and 1.


\subsection{Comparison to experimental data}
Structures sampled by individual lipid molecules in simulations were compared
to experimental data by using C-H bond order parameters \cite{ollila16}
\begin{equation}
S_{\rm CH}=\frac{3}{2}\langle \cos^2\theta -1 \rangle,
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the angle between C-H bond and membrane
normal and average is taken over all sampled configurations.

Bilayer dimensions were compared to experiments by using the
scattering form factor \cite{ollila16}
\begin{equation}
  F(q) = \int _{-D/2} ^{D/2} \left ( \sum _\alpha f_\alpha (q_z) n_\alpha (z) - \rho _s \right ) \exp (izq_z) \mathrm{d}z,
\end{equation}
where $f_\alpha(q_z)$ is the density of atomic scattering length, 
$\rho_s$ is the density of solvent scattering lenght,
$n_\alpha (z)$ is the number density of atom $\alpha$ and
$z$ is the distance from the membrane centre along its normal 
spanning the membrane with thickness $D$. 

Ion binding was compared between experiments and simulations by 
using lipid headgroup order parameters and ''electrometer concept'' 
introduced by Seelig et al. \cite{seelig87,catte16}.
The concept is based on the experimental observation that the 
order parameters of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbons in lipid headgroup
(see Fig. \ref{??} 
\todo{Figure with chemical structure and labeling to be added}) 
are proportional to the amount of bound charge
in lipid bilayer \cite{seelig87}. More recent analysis included also
the order parameter signs and concluded that the order parameters  
decrease with bound positive charge and increase with bound negative 
charge \cite{ollila16,catte16}. The observations are rationalized 
as a change of lipid headgroup dipole tilt to more vertical orientation
with bound positive charge and {\it vice versa} for negative charge \cite{seelig87}. 

%\todo{ongoing,Actual concentration of cations in simulation has yet to be estimated. 
%If it varies too much from the nominal concentration, I may need to tweak the scaling 
%factors, $f_q$ or only $f_\sigma$, to accomodate it. However, it is very unlikely, response 
%to the surfactant \ce{DHMDMAB} is OK. Big patches with loads of solvent are running at the 
%moment to guide me on the possible finite-size errors and this conc-error.
The used experimental data report order parameters as a function of
equilibrium cation concentration in the bulk solvent \cite{akutsu81,altenbach84}.
Such a condition is reached in simulations by adjusting
the simulation box size to dimensions large enough
that ion conceration reaches a clear plateau in the bulk solvent.
The concentrations in the units of $\mathrm{mol/l}$ were then 
determined as
\begin{equation}
  C_{eq}=\frac{C_{plateau}}{0.602},
\end{equation}
where plateau concentration is the number density in the units of $\mathrm{nm}^{-3}$.
\todo{SAMULI: Once we have to final results, we can probably say that
  the repeat distance is not far from the experimentally measured distance \cite{pabst07,uhrikova08}
  }

\subsection{Simulation details}

The simulated systems consisted of 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayer and an aqueous salt solutions of varying concentrations.
Water molecules were described by OPC3 model \cite{Izadi16}.
In order to test transferability of the newly developed ECC-lipids model, 
we also performed several additional simulations with water models 
OPC \cite{Izadi14}, SPC/E \cite{Berendsen1987} and TIP4p/2005 \cite{Abascal2005}
presented in Supporting Information (SI). 
We used ECC-ions model for ions \cite{jungwirth17-new-paper-to-be-published, kohagen16, Pluharova2014}.  % cite order: [Ca_2s, Na_s, Cl_2s]
Simulations with Lipid14 use ion model by Dang \cite{smith94,chang1999,dang2006}. 
The code AmberTools \cite{amber} was then used to generate the Amber-type force field
parameters. The parameters were converted to the Gromacs format by using
acpype tool \cite{acpype}. The partial charges were then manually modified
to approximately correspond to their equivalent segments in Lipid14 \cite{dickson14}.
The surfactants were randomly placed among the lipids to form bilayer structures with
mole fractions 10\%, 20\%, 30\%, 42\% and 50\% of surfactant in the POPC bilayer.

\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{Lipid bilayers without ions}
The scattering form factors, NMR order parameters and area per lipid calculated  
using the ECC-lipids model for POPC are compared to experiments and original
Lipid14 results in Fig. \ref{simVSexpNOions} and in Table~\ref{tab:apls}. 
%The optimal value for $f_\sigma$ was found by representing the overall membrane structure well
%by matching scattering form factors to experimental data~\cite{Petrache06, Kucerka08, Pabst10}.
The structural quality is comparable to the state of art lipid models available in literature \cite{ollila16},
thus we conclude that the ECC-lipids model reproduces the lipid bilayer structure
in liquid disordered phase with similar accuracy to other available models.

Headgroup order parameter response to the bound charge was evaluated against
experimental data measured with the cationic surfactant
(dihexadecyldimethylammonium bromide, C$_{12}$Cl$_{16}$$^+$N2C$_1$Br$^-$) \cite{scherer89}.
The exact amount of bound charge in the membrane is known in these systems, because
practically all cationic surfactant molecules are embedded in the lipid bilayer due to
their amphiphilic nature. Thus, the changes of headgroup order parameter as a function of
mole fraction of cationic surfactants (Fig. \ref{OrderParameterCHANGESnewMODELS}) gives
also the order parameter changes as a function of the amount of bound cations.
\todo{Split the OP-changes figure in two: cationic surfactant -and- binding of cations.
      The separate figure with the cationic surfactant shall be additionally accompanied
      with a plot of Head group tilt (PN-vector?) change/response. }

The headgroup order parameter response to the bound cation concentration
is in experiments approximately linear up to $\sim$0.3 mole fraction of the cation \cite{scherer89}.
The linearity is also observed in simulations with original Lipid14 and with newly derived ECC-lipids models.
Quantitative comparison, however, reveals that the response is overestimated in 
Lipid14 for both segments, while the ECC-lipids model gives a
good agreement for the change of $\alpha$ segment order parameter, and slightly
underestimates the $\beta$ segment order parameter change.
Such a finding is not surprising, as the $\Delta S^\alpha/\Delta S^\beta$ ratio 
of the response of Lipid14 model is found to be slightly larger than in 
experiments (VALexp vs VALsim
\todo{Add values of $S^\alpha/S^\beta$ response for sim and experiment
  SAMULI: Maybe these could be put in the same figure with the order parameter
  response and P-N vector angle change with surfactants.
}
), and this property is also kept by the newly derived Lipid14-based model, ECC-lipids. 
The present comparison of headgroup order parameter changes 
suggests that the observed overestimated response of all models to 
increasing CaCl$_2$ concentration in \cite{catte16} 
can be explained at least in part by a high sensitivity of the headgroup order parameter response
to the bound charge.






\subsection{Cation binding to POPC membrane}

Headgroup order parameter response to increasing CaCl$_2$ concentration
from experiments, original Lipid14 model and ECC-lipids model are shown
in Fig. \ref{OrderParameterCHANGESnewMODELS}. The order parameter response
is significantly overestimated in original Lipid14 model, while results from
ECC-lipids model are in a good agreement with the experiments.
This is a significant improvement over current models,
which in general overstimate the head group order parameter response to CaCl$_2$
concentration \cite{catte16}. The good agreement with experiments indicate
that the binding details of \ce{Ca^2+} are realistic in the ECC-lipids model
and, hence, it can be used to study lipid-ion interaction in detail.

    from simulations and experiments (DPPC \cite{akutsu81}, POPC \cite{altenbach84}, surfactant \cite{scherer89}).
  }
\end{figure*}

Ion density profiles from simulations with different models are compared in Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl-dens}.
The density profiles from simulations with original Lipid14 \cite{dickson14} and Dang ions \cite{smith94,chang1999,dang2006} 
show a pronounced peak in the position of the phosphate moieties of POPC. 
The use of a ECC-ion model~\cite{kohagen14,kohagen16} 
or the standard Amber ion model by \AA{quist} 
along with Lipid14 does not significantly change it 
(Headgroup order parameter responses for these models in SI).
\todo{Add OP-response of Lipid14+ECC-ions into the OP-changes plot in SI}
The new ECC-lipids model with ECC-ions exhibits on the other hand smaller density in this region 
suggesting overall weaker binding of cations (Fig.~\ref{OrderParameterCHANGESnewMODELS}). 
Together with the accurate head group order parameter response (Fig.~\ref{OrderParameterCHANGESnewMODELS}),
the decrease in cation density of ECC-lipids demonstrates that 
ion binding to zwitterionic phospholipid membranes can be accurately
described with classical MD simulation models that account for electronic polarizability.

\end{figure}

Good agreement of ECC-lipids model with experiments encourages us to analyse the
binding details from MD simulations. Direct analysis of contacts between ions and
lipids from simulations suggest that the most abundant POPC:\ce{Ca^2+} complex 
have stoichiometry of 2~POPC:1~\ce{Ca^{2+}}.
As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:cacl-bind} this is in agreement
with the ternary complex model suggested based on headgroup order parameter
experiments~\cite{altenbach84}.
In addition to the ternary complexes, there also is a non-negligable probability
of one \ce{Ca^{2+}} cross-bridging three POPC molecules.

\section{Conclusions}
We show that the \ce{Na^+} and \ce{Ca^2+} binding in phospholipid bilayers can
be accurately described with classical MD simulation models, where electronic
polarization is effectively included by using electronic continuum correction.
This is a significant improvement over other available lipid models,
which all overestimate specific cation binding affinities \cite{catte16}.  
The newly proposed model, which we denote as ''ECC-lipids~17'', 
reproduces the lipid bilayer structural details
with similar accuracy as other state of the art lipid models.
ECC-lipids~17 exhibit accurate headgroup order parameter response to
bound cations, monovalent \ce{Na^+} and cationic surfactant dihexadecyldimethylammonium bromide, 
and divalent \ce{Ca^2+}.
Several water models 
(OPC3\cite{Izadi16}, OPC \cite{Izadi14}, SPC/E \cite{Berendsen1987} and TIP4p/2005 \cite{Abascal2005}) 
were used to exemplify the transferability of 
the parameters of the new ECC-lipids~17 force field. 

Direct analysis of calcium binding details from MD simulations is in agreement
with ternary complex model, which is suggested based on NMR data \cite{altenbach84}.
In this model 1~calcium binds to 2~POPC molecules, which together form a ternary
complex.

The electronic continuum correction is applied here on Lipid14 POPC model \cite{dickson14},
but we expect that the correction can be generalized also for other lipids
and force fields.


This work will serve as a foundation stone of a 
new open-collaboration project NMRlipids~VI in nmrlipids.blogspot.fi.
