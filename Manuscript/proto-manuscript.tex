Classical molecular dynamics simulations give detailed information about membrane structure and dynamics. However, there is still a room for improvements in current force fields – it is known from the literature, that the binding of ions, especially cations, to phopholipid membranes is overestimated in all classical models [1]. We suggest that the membrane-ion interactions can be corrected by including implicit electronic polarizability into the lipid models through the electronic continuum correction (ECC) [2], which was already applied to monovalent and divalent ions yielding models that feature correct ion pairing [3]. Using the electrometer concept [3, 4], our simulations point out that our hypothesis is correct and ECC is indeed a missing important contribution in current classical lipid models. Moreover, the solid physical principles behind ECC are found not to hamper other relevant properties of a phospholipid bilayer. 
The new lipid model, "ECClipids", shows accurate affinity to sodium and calcium cations. 
This work will continue as an open collaboration project NMRlipids IV (http://nmrlipids.blogspot.fi).

\textbf{General Introduction}

 motivation, significance of membranes, phospholipids and simulation.

 assumptions (so that we have structure of the paper like in a mathematical proof) -- 
 MD simulation is a good tool for studying molecules.
 classical MD models can describe lipids accurately, 

 MD is ... and it serves ... it is useful for ... (describe throuhg references)

 Lipid membranes, especially phospholipid membranes; their significance for life, sciences, society, pharma ...

\textbf{Specific introduction: current FFs and MDEC/ECC}

 Current force fields -- pros and cons, at a good shape in many aspects, agree on various properties. 

 lipid force fields fail in description of membrane-cation interaction -- could be answered by ECC? 
Cations were shown to generally overbind in PC lipid bilayers in
NMRlipids II project. Here we propose that the cation overbinding can
be corrected by implicitly inducing electronic polarizability in
lipid headgroups by scaling the partial charges.

MDEC -- or -- ECC 
\todoii{choose one}{We have to decide whether we will refer to the method as a correction (ECC) or as a MD simulation paradigm (MDEC) -- and choose on of these labels.}
MD in electronic continuum as in \cite{Leontyev2015} or electronic continuum correction as in \cite{Jungwirth2015}

Describe ECC: good physical concept for treating part of the polarizability (electronic) in a simple mean-field way.

Succesful application: Works for cations \cite{Jungwirth2015,Kohagen..}\todoii{REF}{Missing references} -- motivation for its application to zwitterionic lipids like POPC.

Hypothesis: ECC helps in describing even zwitterionic molecules like POPC, will be demonstrated through headgroup order parameter response to cationic molecules.

\textbf{Main body starts:}

ECC and solvation $\Delta G$.(from \cite{Leontyev2015}: hydration $\Delta G$ can provide good structure and energetics, but will fail in good interactions -- already proved for cations)
In addition, $\Delta G_{hyd}$ -- the usual target for parametrization of small molecules in classical force fields -- is not the right target in the MDEC/ECC paradigm -- part of $\Delta G$ is already included in the polarization of electrons, and only the remining part of $\Delta G$ belongs to the polarization of the nuclei. 
Hence it is non trivial, how large should be the scaling factor $f_\sigma$ -- it should lay between $1$ and $f_q$, the limits for the original interaction energy and its limit when we neglect the $\Delta G_{el}$ term in $\Delta G_{hyd}$. 


How do I apply ECC on Lipid14 POPC and why such choice (i.e. $f_\sigma$, $f_q$ and definition of the scaled region).

why did I choose Lipid 14 -- good ratio of $\alpha / \beta$ response.

\textbf{Observations, how does the system behave, what are its macroscopic properties:}

Accurate electrometer response to \ce{Na^+}, \ce{Ca^{2+}} and \ce{DHMDMAB} cationic surfactant. 
The response of the headgroup order parameters is improved both through diminished affinity towards the cations and through lower headgroup response to the bound charge (from simulations with \ce{DHMDMAB} surfactant). 
The best models from Fig.  \ref{OrderParameterIONSchangesSCALED} are shown in
Fig. \ref{OrderParameterCHANGESnewMODELS}. Based on these results we choose

Preserves other relevant properties: APL, Order Parameters (OPs), diffusion? \todoi{diffusion can be even improved}, elasticity? \todoi{check elastic properties -- do they change, improve, worsen??} -- however, it is still garbage in-garbage out
The glycerol backbone and headgroup order parameters are plotted in
Fig \ref{HGopsNEWmodels.eps} for reference models and EEC models. The difference,
i.e. the effect of scaling on these parameters, is shown in Fig. \ref{HGopsNEWmodelsCHANGE}.

Gives correct scattering form factor -- good ground for interpretting experimental data.

Provides/predicts correct stoichiometry for \ce{Na^+}, \ce{Ca^{2+}} and their interaction energies with the lipid membrane.
Samuli: the main selling argument would be that we solve the details (stoichiometry, coordination numbers, etc.) of cation binding in PC bilayer. 

\textbf{Required figures}

Figure comparing order parameters and form factor between original Lipid14, new model and experiments,

- Figure showing order parameters as a function of \ce{NaCl} and \ce{CaCl_2} concentrations from Lipid14, new model and experiments (like current Fig. 1, but only original and final models)

- Figure(s) analysing binding details (density profiles, lipids bound per ion, something else?).


\textbf{Discussion:}

other lipids: charged lipid? -- ongoing research in our lab (starting to do something with Aniket on POPE for curved membranes)
Samuli: From the point of view of this paper, the most relevant other lipid to study would be DPPC to see if we can reproduce the difference between POPC and DPPC in experiments.

Role of water model: we use OPC3 (current best), it would be worth giving an estimate how results change when we use say SPCE or even TIP3p at least in the SI (so that the reader knows what errors to expect comming from these sub-optimal models). In addition, there is protein force field Amber15-FB, which uses water close to OPC3, TIP3pFB \todoii{REFs}{add references here}.

questionable charge distribution from RESP -- a leeway for further tweaks of the FF.
It is not obvious that RESP charges provide the best description, especially due to its non-uniqe solution. 
Shall we solve RESP fitting with the constraint of full charges and then scale down, or shall we rather solve the fitting with a scaled total charge target?

acheivable accuracy of the MD engines themselves (mainly Hector's worry) is another limiting factor in fine tuning parameters -- solid physical ground helps.

application of the correction to other lipid models: The rule looks general, however, it depends on how accurate the original model was.
From preliminary simulations with POPE, it looks that the rule works for Lipid14 FF, at least for zwitterionic headgroups.

\textbf{Conclusion:}

Reiterate what we did...

This will be a foundation stone of a new open-collaboration project NPRlipid 6 in nmrlipids.blogspot.fi....
