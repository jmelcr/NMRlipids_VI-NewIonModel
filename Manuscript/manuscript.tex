Binding affinities and stoichiometries of Na$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$ ions to phospholipid
bilayers are of paramount significance in the properties and functionality of cellular
membranes. For example, possible accumulation of ions at the membrane interface determines
the interaction affinity with charged species. Current estimates of binding affinities and
stoichiometries of cations are controversial due to limitations in the experimental and
theoretical methods available. Experimentally one can assess these parameters by titrating
several membrane properties as a function of the ions concentration. However, the
interpretation of the obtained results requires theoretical models. Considering that the
real behavior is unknown these models are at best idealizations. Classical molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations provide details of the ions binding process with atomistic
resolution. Therefore, MD a priory offers all necessary information to interpret
experimental data without the need to resort to simplified models. However, the accuracy
of the available lipid models when interacting with ions is currently limited. In this
work, we improve the binding details of Na$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$ ions to the
1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine POPC) bilayer by implicitly including electronic
polarization. We do this by applying a mean field correction to the partial charges known
as the electronic continuum correction (ECC) to a selected state of the art POPC lipid
model for MD simulations. Our improved ECC-POPC model reproduces not only the
experimentally measured structural parameters for the ion-free membrane, but also the
response of lipid headgroup to a bound positive charge, and the binding affinities of 
Na$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$ ions. We also observe negligible binding of Na$^+$ ions to POPC
bilayer and stronger interactions of Ca$^{2+}$ primarily with phosphate oxygens in our new
model is in agreement with available experimental spectroscopic data. This new model
results in Ca$^{2+}$ ions forming complexes with one to three POPC molecules with almost
equal probabilities which suggests that previous models used to interpret NMR data are too
simple. The results of this work pave the way to quantitative MD simulations of complex
biochemical systems with realistic electrostatic interactions in the vicinity of cellular
membranes.

\section{Introduction}
Cation interactions with cellular membranes play a key role in important biological processes,
such as signal propagation in neurons and vesicle fusion.
Since direct measurements of ion-membrane interactions in biological systems
are difficult, lipid bilayers are often used as models systems for cellular
membranes. In particular, the zwitterionic phosphocholine (PC) lipid bilayers are
used as entry level models, helping to understand the role of ions in complex biological
systems~\cite{scherer87,seelig90,cevc90}.

Interactions of biologically relevant cations, especially Na$^+$ and
Ca$^{2+}$, with PC bilayers have been widely studied in
experiments~\cite{akutsu81,altenbach84,seelig90,cevc90,tocanne90,binder02,pabst07,uhrikova08}
and classical MD simulations~\cite{bockmann03,bockmann04,Berkowitz12,melcrova16,javanainen17}.
The details of ion binding are, however, not fully consistent in the literature.
%not agreed in the literature \cite{cevc90,tocanne90,seelig90,binder02,catte16,??}.
%General conclusion from experimental
%studies has been that multivalent ions and lithium have weak specific binding in
%phopholipid bilayers, while other monovalent ions do not essentially
%bind 
%The presence of anoinic lipids, like PS or PG,
%increase the concentration close to the bilayer and thus the amount of bound
%ions, but do not affect the specific binding constant \cite{seelig90}.
Interpretations of non-invansive spectroscopic methods, like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), as well as scattering
and infrared spectroscopies, suggest that Na$^+$ ions exhibit only
negligible binding to PC lipid bilayers wat submolar concentrations, while Ca$^{2+}$ is observed to specifically
bind to phosphate groups of two lipid molecules~\cite{hauser76,hauser78,herbette84,akutsu81,altenbach84,binder02,pabst07,uhrikova08}.
Atomistic resolution molecular dynamics (MD) simulation models, however, typically predict a
stronger binding for the cations than NMR experiments \cite{catte16}.
On the other hand, several experiments have also been interpreted to support the predictions from
earlier MD simulations~\cite{bockmann03,vacha09a}. 
Furthermore, interactions of calcium ions with up to 3-4 lipids,
including not only interactions with phosphates but also with carbonyl
oxygens, have been reported from simulations~\cite{bockmann03,bockmann04,melcrova16,javanainen17}.


Recent studies within the NMRlipids project (\url{nmrlipids.blogspot.fi})~\cite{catte16}
made an attempt to resolve these apparent controversies. A direct comparison of
ion binding affinities to PC bilayers between simulations and
experiments was done using the electrometer concept, which is based on experimental NMR data
for the lipid headgroup order parameters~\cite{seelig87}.
Analyzing massive amounts of data collected by the Open Collaboration method, it was concluded
that the accuracy of the current state of the art lipid models for MD
simulations is not sufficient for a detailed interpretation of the
interactions of cations with PC lipid bilayers~\cite{catte16}.

%\todo{PAVEL: introduce previous theoretical work that discusses cation binding to POPC w.r.t. its specific moiteties, e.g. Lukas' paper}.

%While relative binding affinity of different ions in PC lipids is agreed to follow Hoffmeister
%series, the molecular details of binding and binding energetics are

%The binding details, like binding sites and stoichiometry are not yet fully
%resolved but interpretation of NMR and scattering experiments suggest that one
%Ca2+ interacts mainly with the choline groups \cite{hauser76,hauser78,herbette84} of two
%phospholipid molecules \cite{altenbach84}.

In this work, we show that the cation binding behavior
in MD simulations of the 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayer can be significantly 
improved via an implicit inclusion of the electronic polarizability
in the polar region of phospholipids,
which we apply using to the 
electronic continuum correction (ECC)~\cite{leontyev11}.
Such an approach has been previously shown to improve the behaviour of
of ions in bulk water simulations ~\cite{jungwirth17-new-paper-to-be-published,Pluharova2014,kohagen14,kohagen16}. 
We employ here the the Lipid14 model \cite{dickson14} as a starting point,
because it provided one of the best available descriptions of cation binding \cite{catte16}.
The newly developed ECC-lipids model reproduces the experimentally
measurable structural parameters of an ion-free POPC lipid bilayer with the 
accuracy comparable to the other state of the art lipid models, while surpassing
them significantly in the description of the membrane binding affinities to cations and induced
structural effects of sodium and calcium ions.


%Since the cation binding affinity and the headgroup 
%order parameter changes are in good agreement with experiments
%in the proposed ECC-lipids, it can be used to interpret the
%related structural changes and ion binding stoichiometry.
%New lipid models with correct ion binding affinity in lipid
%bilayers are necessary in applications of 
%MD simulations with physiological salt conditions. 
%The overestimated cation binding in the current lipid models \cite{catte16}
%may lead to significant artefacts in MD simulations. For example,
%articifially positively charged membranes overestimate interactions
%with biomolecules having opposite sign.


\section{Methods}

\subsection{Electronic continuum correction for lipid bilayers}\label{section:ecc}
The lack of electronic polarizability in standard MD simulation
force fields has been considered a serious issue since the early days of
lipid bilayer simulations.
In this work, we circumvent the rather demanding explicit inclusion
of electronic polarization effects \cite{lucas12,chowdhary13} by
including the electronic part of polarizability in lipid
bilayer simulations implicitly via 
the electronic continuum correction (ECC)~\cite{leontyev11}. 
Technically, this is similar to the phenomenological charge-scaling applied in 
earlier studies of aqueous solutions or ionic liquids \cite{jonsson86,egberts94,beichel14}.
However, the present concept of ECC is
physically well justified and rigorously derived~\cite{leontyev09, leontyev10, leontyev11, leontyev14}.


According to ECC, the electronic
polarizability can be implicitly included in classical MD simulations by
placing all particles into a homogeneous dielectric continuum 
with a dielectric constant $\epsilon _{el}$, 
which is the electronic part of the dielectric constant of 
the medium \cite{leontyev11}. 
Following the Coulomb's law, such a dielectric continuum can be 
directly included in a standard MD simulation by
scaling of charges,
\begin{equation}
  Q^{ECC} = f_q \cdot Q ,
\end{equation}
with a constant scaling factor of $f_q = \epsilon _{el} ^{-1/2}$ 
. 
Given the  high frequency dielectric constant as measured in water (corresponding to the square of the refraction index) of  $\epsilon _{el} = 1.78$,  
the scaling factor for aqueous ions is $f_q = 0.75$ \cite{some_orig_source, leontyev11}. This scaling factor has been
successfully used to improve the performance of force field simulations of ions in aqueous solution \cite{kohagen14,kohagen16,??},
which then agree quantitatively with neutron scattering data \cite{kohagen14,kohagen16, Pluharova2014}. 

While the scaling factor of $f_q = 0.75$ for ions in water improves their description and is physically well justified within the ECC theory \cite{Leontyev2011},
it is not a priori  clear whether the same factor should be used for partial charges in molecules,
e.g., lipids in our case. Unlike the total charge of an ion, atomic partial charges within molecules are not physical observables.
Several schemes exist for the assignment of partial charges for biomolecules~\cite{Hu2007}.
Currently, the most commonly employed scheme is the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) method~\cite{RESP_paper,Singh1984}.
By construction, partial charges currently implemented in force fields may already 
include  to some extent the electronic polarizability effects of the solvent, i.g.,
the RESP charges may be modified during fitting or subsequently after it 
to improve certain experimental observables 
\cite{RESP_paper,Singh1984,jorgensen96,ipolq2013,benavides17}. 
Thus, a consistent application of the ECC scaling factor, $f_q$, to the partial charges in molecules as
included in the available force fields does not necessarily have to follow the above relation $f_q = \epsilon _{el} ^{-1/2}$. 
Instead, a consistent scaling factor would lie between the value of 0.75 i.e., (no electronic polarizability included in the original partial charges)
and $1$ (i.e., electronic polarizability fully included in the original partial charges).
It is important to note that even though the lipid bilayer interface has a large gradient in
the total dielectric constant, the electronic part of polarizability can be considered to be almost constant
as measurements give values around 2 
for almost any biologically relevant systems \cite{some_original_work, leontyev11}.


In this work, we employ ECC to develop a force field model for
the POPC lipid that accurately describes the binding of sodium and calcium ions to the corresponding lipid bilayer.
%This is a biologically highly relevant membrane feature, which is
%poorly reproduced by currently available models. This can affect not only on membrane properties
%in the presence of ions but also modulate interactions with charged moieties at the interface.
The quality of the simulation model is judged by comparison 
to experimental NMR data reporting on the ion binding
affinity~\cite{akutsu81,altenbach84,scherer89}, 
as discussed in detail in Ref.~\citenum{catte16}.
The Lipid14~\cite{dickson14} force field parameters (available in a Gromacs format from Ref. \citenum{lipid14files})
were used as a starting point, as they provide one of the most
realistic descriptions of the head group order parameter response to ions 
among the available lipid models (see Figs.~2~and~5 in Ref.~\citenum{catte16}).
Moreover, the Lipid14 model has a relatively realistic glycerol backbone and
head group structure comparable to other state of the art lipid models~\cite{botan15}.

We applied the ECC correction to the Lipid14 model of POPC by scaling of partial charges of the head group,
glycerol backbone, and carbonyl regions, which are the polar parts in phospholipids,
expected to have a contribution to the cation binding.
We did not modify the hydrocarbon chain parameters, 
as they do not come in direct contact with ions from the solution 
and as they are already highly optimized to provide a good description of the
hydrophobic part of lipid bilayers \cite{dickson14,ollila16}.
The latter is in contrasts with the situation for the glycerol backbone and the head group regions, 
which calls for improvements in available lipid models~\cite{botan15}.

The above discussed interval for the scaling factor, $f_q~\in~(0.75, 1.0)$,
was explored to find the optimal value reproducing the experimental ion binding affinities.
We first observed that the scaling
of the partial charges reduced the ion binding affinity and the 
related head group order parameter response in general.
We then compared the results with different scaling factors to the experimental 
NMR data~\cite{akutsu81,altenbach84,scherer89} finding the optimal 
value $f_q = 0.8$,
which is only slighly higher than the original scaling factor for the ions in water of 0.75.

Although scaling of the partial charges improved 
the head group order parameter response and ion binding affinity,
it at the same time deteriorated certain membrane properties; 
namely the area per lipid decreased below the experimental value. 
After directly scaling the partial charges of the head group, the glycerol
backbone, and carbonyls with a factor of 0.8, 
the area per lipid in the simulation drops approximately to 60~\AA$^2$,
which is smaller than the experimental value of 64.3~\AA$^2$ \cite{kucerka11}, 
as well as the value from the original Lipid14 model of $65.6 \pm 0.5$~\AA$^2$~\cite{dickson14}.
The decrease of the area per lipid is found to arise from a reduced hydration of the lipid head group region
due a reduced head group polarity after scaling charges. 
This effect is compensated
by reducing the effective radii of atoms with the scaled charges.
This is in practice done by changing the parameters $\sigma$ in the Lennard-Jones potential 
in a similar way as was done previously for the ECC-ions in solution \cite{kohagen14,kohagen16,Pluharova2014}.
After reducing the $\sigma$ parameters of affected atoms by a factor of $f_\sigma = 0.89$, 
the area per molecule is restored
back, being very close to the experimental value (Table~\ref{tab:apls}). 




\subsection{Electrometer concept} \label{section:electrometer}
Ion binding in lipid bilayers was compared between experiments and simulations 
using the lipid head group order parameters and the
''electrometer concept'' \cite{seelig87,catte16}, which
is based on the experimental observation that the C-H bond
order parameters of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbons in a PC lipid head group
(Fig.~\ref{simVSexpNOions}) are proportional to the amount 
of charge bound per lipid~\cite{seelig87}.
The change of the order parameters measured with varying aqueous
ion concentrations can be then related to the amount of bound ions.

The electrometer concept can be used to compare the ion binding affinity to lipid 
bilayers between MD simulations and  NMR experiments, because the order
parameters can be accurately determined from both techniques~\cite{catte16,ollila16}.
The order parameters for all C-H bonds in lipid molecules, including
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ segments in head group, can be accurately measured
using $^2$H NMR or $^{13}$C NMR techniques \cite{ollila16}. From MD simulations the
order parameters can be calculated using the definition
\begin{equation}\label{OP}
S_{\rm CH}=\frac{3}{2}\langle \cos^2\theta -1 \rangle,
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the angle between the bond and membrane
normal and the average is taken over all sampled configurations \cite{ollila16}.

The relation between the amount of the bound charge per lipid,  $X^\pm$, and
the head group order parameter change, $\Delta S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}$,
is empirically quantified as~\cite{seelig87,ferreira16}
\begin{equation}\label{OPchangeEQ}
  \Delta S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}= S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}(X^\pm)-S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}(0) \approx \frac{4m_i }{3\chi}X^\pm,
\end{equation}
where $S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}(0)$ denote the order parameter in the absence of bound charge,
$i$ refers to either $\alpha$ or $\beta$ carbon,
$m_i$ is an empirical constant depending on the valency and position of the bound charge,
and the experimental value \cite{seelig77,davis83}, $\chi \approx$\,167\,kHz, is used for the quadrupole coupling constant.
Atomic absorption spectra and $^2$H NMR data gave
$m_\alpha=-20.5$~kHz  and $m_\beta=-10.0$~kHz for the binding of
Ca$^{2+}$ to POPC bilayer (in the presence of 100~mM NaCl)~\cite{altenbach84,ollila16,catte16}.
The slopes are negative, because the head group order parameters
decrease with a bound positive charge and increase with a bound negative
charge~\cite{ollila16,catte16}. This can be rationalized in terms of a change
of the lipid head group dipole tilt towards water phase with the bound positive
charge and {\it vice versa} with the negative charge~\cite{seelig87}. 

The measured change of the order parameter depends both on the head group response 
to the bound charge and on the amount of the bound charge 
(i.e. $m_i$ and $X^\pm$ in Eq.~\ref{OPchangeEQ}, respectively). 
The empirical factor $m_i$ has to be
properly quantified before the electrometer concept can used to 
analyze the binding affinities.
This has been done experimentally for a wide range
of systems~\cite{seelig87,beschiasvili91}. To calibrate 
the response of the head group order parameter to the bound charge in simulations,
we use experimental data for a strong cationic surfactant dihexadecyldimethylammoniumbromide %(2C$_{16}$$^+$N2C$_1$Br$^-$)
mixed within a POPC bilayer~\cite{scherer89}. Dihexadecyldimethylammonium\\[0.5cm]

is a cationic surfactant having two acyl chains and bearing a unit
charge in the hydrophilic end. Thus, it is expected to locate
in the bilayer similarly to the phospholipids and its molar ratio then 
gives directly the amount of bound unit charge per lipid $X^\pm$ in these systems~\cite{scherer89}.

\subsection{Salt concentrations and binding affinity}
The concentrations of salts are reported in two different ways
in the NMR measurements of head group order parameters \cite{akutsu81, altenbach84}.
The early work on the NMR electrometer concept 
reports the salt concentrations in water before solvating
the lipids~\cite{akutsu81}. 
The later study uses the atomic absorption
spectroscopy, and reports the salt concentration in the supernatant after the
solvation of lipids~\cite{altenbach84}.
In this work, we focus on POPC for which the latter definition was used~\cite{altenbach84}.
The salt concentration in the aqueous bulk region was taken as that at 
the farthest point from the lipid bilayer in the aqueous phase. 
Note that in the previous study~\cite{catte16},
the ion concentrations were calculated in water before solvating the lipids, 
as in the earlier experiments~\cite{akutsu81}.
Although there are noticable differences between these two
definitions for concentrations of the CaCl$_2$ systems,
they do not affect significantly conclusions drawn in this work or in the previous one~\cite{catte16}.

To quantify the ion binding affinities to a lipid bilayer, we
calculate the relative surface excess of ions with respect to water,~$\Gamma_i^w$~\cite{chattorajBOOK}.
Such a quantity compares the adsorption of ions to the adsorption of water molecules 
at the interface without the necessity of defining a Gibbs dividing plane 
between the membrane interior and the water bulk region. 
In our simulations we only assume that the interface is located between the ion-free hydrophobic interior
of the lipid bilayer and the aqueous region far from the membrane.
%our whole simulation box as
%an interface flanked by a water phase and an ideal phase with the characteristics of to
%the hydrophobic region in the middle of the membrane where no ions or waters are present.
Such a setup and the above definition of bulk ion concentration provide a simple relation for the relative surface excess $\Gamma_i^w$ for simulations of lipid bilayers, 
\begin{equation}\label{surfexcess}
  \Gamma_i^w=\frac{1}{2A_b} \left ( n_i - n_w \frac{C_i}{C_w} \right ) .
\end{equation}
Here, $n_w$ and $n_i$ are the total numbers of water molecules and ions in the system,
$C_w$ and $C_i$ are their respective bulk concentrations in the aqueous phase,
and $A_b$ is the area of the unit cell in the membrane plane.
The total area of the interface is then twice the area of the membrane, i.e., $2A_b$,
because the bilayer has an interface at each of the two leaflets.



\subsection{Validation of lipid bilayer structure against experiments}

The structures of lipid bilayers in simulations without ions were validated against NMR and 
\mbox{x-ray} scattering experiments by calculating the order parameters
for the C-H bonds and the scattering form factors. The former validates the structures sampled by the individual
lipid molecules in simulations with atomic resolution, while the latter
validates the dimensions of the lipid bilayer (i.e., its thickness and area per
molecule)~\cite{ollila16}.

The simulated order parameters were calculated for all C-H bonds
in lipid molecules from Eq. \ref{OP}. Form factors were calculated 
from the equation
\begin{equation}
  F(q) = \int _{-D/2} ^{D/2} \left ( \rho_{el}(z) - \rho_{el}^s \right ) \cos (zq_z) \mathrm{d}z,
  %F(q) = \int _{-D/2} ^{D/2} \left ( \sum _\alpha f_\alpha (q_z) n_\alpha (z) - \rho _s \right ) \exp (izq_z) \mathrm{d}z,
\end{equation}
where $\rho_{el} (z)$ is the total electron density,
$\rho_{el}^s$ is the electron density of the solvent far in the aqueous bulk,
and $z$ is the distance from the membrane centre along its normal 
with $D/2$ being half of the unit cell size. 




\subsection{Simulation details}

\subsubsection{Simulations of POPC bilayers with aqueous ions}
Simulations of a POPC bilayer in pure water or at varying salt concentrations
consisted of 128 POPC molecules and approximately 50~SPC/E~water~\cite{Berendsen1987} molecules per each lipid
in an orthorhombic simulation box with periodic boundary conditions. 
The chosen SPC/E water model, used also in the previous parametrization of 
ECC-ions \cite{jungwirth17-new-paper-to-be-published, kohagen16, Pluharova2014},
has a lowered dielectric constant, consistent with the ECC concept~\cite{leontyev11, leontyev14}.
Results from simulations with other water models 
(OPC \cite{Izadi14}, OPC3~\cite{Izadi16}, 
TIP3P~\cite{jorgensen83},
TIP3p-FB and TIP4p-FB~\cite{Wang2014},
and TIP4p/2005 \cite{Abascal2005}), performed to check for robustness of our approach, are available in SI.
Sodium, calcium, and chloride 
were modeled as ECC-ions with parameters from \citenum{jungwirth17-new-paper-to-be-published, Pluharova2014}.  % cite order: [Ca_2s, Na_s, Cl_2s]
Scaled charges and van der Waals radii for atoms forming the POPC lipid were derived here, starting from the Lipid14 force field.
For comparison, simulations with unscaled charges were perfomed using the Lipid14 model, the TIP3p model for water \cite{jorgensen83} and the ion model by
Dang et al.~\cite{smith94,chang1999,dang2006}.
Simulation data for the Lipid14 model with \AA{}qvist~\cite{aqvist90} ions and TIP3P~\cite{jorgensen83}
water models reported in \cite{catte16} 
were taken directly from \cite{lipid14POPC0mMNaClfiles,lipid14POPC350mMCaClfiles,lipid14POPC350mMCaClfilesNC,lipid14POPC1000mMNaClfiles}. 
MD simulations were performed using the GROMACS \cite{Abraham15} simulation package (version 5.1.4).  
The simulation settings employed in this work are 
summarized in Table \ref{tbl:mdpar}. 
The simulatied trajectories and parameters are available at \cite{??} \todo{To be uploaded to Zenodo}. 



\subsubsection{Simulations of POPC bilayers with cationic surfactants}
The topology of dihexadecyldimethylammonium
was created with an automated topology builder \cite{malde11}. 
The AmberTools program \cite{amber} was then used to generate the Amber-type force field
parameters. These parameters were then converted to the Gromacs format with
the acpype tool \cite{acpype}. The partial charges were then manually modified
to approximately correspond to their equivalent segments in Lipid14 \cite{dickson14}.
The parameters together with the simulation data are available
at~\cite{POPClipid14T313K,POPClipid1410perCATsurfT313K,POPClipid1420perCATsurfT313K,POPClipid1430perCATsurfT313K,POPClipid1442perCATsurfT313K,POPClipid1450perCATsurfT313K}.
The cationic surfactants were randomly mixed among the phospholipids to form bilayer structures with
mole fractions of 10\%, 20\%, 30\%, 42\%, or 50\% of surfactant in the POPC bilayer.
All these systems contained 50 POPC molecules per leaflet, 6340 TIP3P~\cite{jorgensen83} water molecules, and
6, 14, 21, 35, or 50 surfactants per leaflet. 
Chloride counter ions were used in simulations, 
while bromide was the counter ion in the experiment \cite{scherer89}.
The Lipid14 model was used for POPC.
The first 20~ns of the total simulation time of 200~ns
was considered as an equlibration time and was omitted from the analysis.
Sufficient lipid neighbor exchange occured during the simulations.

The systems were simulated with the ECC-lipids model for POPC 
and SPC/E model for water using the same setup.
In these simulations ECC was also applied to the cationic surfactant 
in the same way as to POPC, i.e.,

First, we present results for bilayers in pure water.
The ECC-lipids and Lipid14 models both reproduce the experimental x-ray scattering form factors
of a POPC bilayer with a comparable accuracy in Fig.~\ref{simVSexpNOions}.
The area per lipid from the Lipid14 model is slightly larger than the
experimental value in Table~\ref{tab:apls}, while the value from the ECC-lipids model
is slightly smaller. The values of the area per lipid of the ECC-lipids model show small variations
when simulated with different water models (see Table~\ref{tab:apls_si} in SI),
with all being close to the experimentally reported values.
We can thus conclude that the ECC-lipids model reproduces the experimental dimensions of the POPC
lipid bilayer with accuracy comparable to that for other state of the art lipid models \cite{ollila16}.
%The optimal value for $f_\sigma$ was found by representing the overall membrane structure well
%by matching scattering form factors to experimental data~\cite{Petrache06, Kucerka08, Pabst10}.

Similarly, the acyl chain order parameters of the
ECC-lipids model, as well as the Lipid14 model~\cite{dickson14}, agree 
with the experimental values with in the error bars, as presented
in Fig.~\ref{simVSexpNOions}. Notably, the experimentally measured forking and
small order parameter values of $C_2$ segment in {\it sn}-2 chain are well
reproduced by both models. This feature has been suggested to indicate that the carbonyl
of {\it sn}-2 chain is directed towards the water phase, in contrast to the
carbonyl in {\it sn}-1 chain, which would orient more along the bilayer
plane~\cite{seelig75,schindler75,gawrisch92}. This may be an important
feature for the ion binding details, which it is not fully reproduced by other
available lipid models~\cite{ollila16}
%This is expected as the ECC model does not modify
%the already highly optimized parameters of this region in Lipid14. 

The order parameters of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbons in the headgroup are slightly larger
in the ECC-lipids model than in the Lipid14 model, which is apparently related to the
P-N vector orienting by about 7$^{\circ}$ more toward the water phase in the ECC-lipids model, 
see Fig.~\ref{OrderParameterCHANGESsurf}. This is a small change and with the current experimental data we cannot decide which of the two models provides more realistic
headgroup conformations. The ECC-lipids model gives
the $\beta$ carbon order parameter value closer to experiments than the Lipid14 model, while
the oposite is true for the $\alpha$ carbon.
Despite small deviations from the experimental order parameter values
in Fig. \ref{simVSexpNOions},
the accuracy of both models in the glycerol backbone region
is comparable to other state
of art lipid models available in literature \cite{botan15}.

            Response of POPC head groups to bound charge}\label{section:boundCHARGE}

\begin{figure}[tb!]

    a molar fraction of the cationic surfactant dihexadecyldimethylammonium in a POPC bilayer
    from simulations and experiments \cite{scherer89}.
  }
\end{figure}

Before proceeding to the sodium and calcium  ion binding affinities, we quantify
the response of the headgroup order parameters to the amount of 
bound charge by using mixtures of monovalent cationic
surfactants (dihexadecyldimethylammonium)
and POPC~\cite{scherer89}. The amount of bound charge per PC 
in these systems is given simply by the molar fraction of cationic 
surfactants, because essentially all the surfactants with two hydrophopic
acyl chains can be assumed to locate in the lipid bilayers.
The experimental data for these systems can be used to validate 
the sensitivity of lipid headgroup order parameters
to the amount of bound charge in simulations.

The changes of the headgroup order parameters with increasing amount of 
the cationic surfactant are compared for simulations and experiments~\cite{scherer89} in Fig. \ref{OrderParameterCHANGESsurf}.
An approximately linear decrease of the order parameters, as expected from Eq. \ref{OPchangeEQ},
is observed in both simulations and experiments at least for mole fractions
below $\sim$30\%. The slope is, however, too steep in the Lipid14 model indicating that 
the head group order parameters respond too sensitively to the bound positive charge.
In contrast, the slope for the ECC-lipids model is in a very good agreement with experiments
for the $\alpha$ segment, while being slightly
underestimated for the $\beta$ segment.

The headgroup P-N vector angle with respect to the membrane normal
is also shown in Fig.~\ref{OrderParameterCHANGESsurf}
as a function of the mole fraction of the cationic surfactant.
As suggested previously~\cite{seelig87}, the headgroup orients
more towards the water phase with the increasing amount of positive
charge in a PC lipid bilayer. The effect is more pronounced in the
Lipid14 model, for which the addition of 50\% mole fraction of the cationic
surfactant leads to the decrease of 20$^{\circ}$ of the P-N vector angle,
while the corresponding change in the ECC-lipids model is 11$^{\circ}$.
The difference is in line with the smaller order parameter 
changes and the reduced charge--dipole interactions in the latter model.
The lower sensitivity of the P-N vector angle response in the ECC-lipid
model can be considered to be more realistic, because the changes of the headgroup
order parameters as a function of the bound positive charge
are in better agreement with experiments in this model.
The results also imply that validation and improvements of MD simulation
models are generally required for reliable simulation studies of the
lipid headgroup responses to ions or other biomolecules, as also suggested
previously \cite{botan15}.


%
%Therefore we use the data in Fig.~\ref{OrderParameterCHANGESsurf}
%to suggest a linear relation between $\alpha$-carbon order parameter
%and average P-N vector angle changes $\Delta \Theta_{\rm P-N}=?? \Delta S_{\rm CH}^{\alpha}$.
%This can be used to estimate the change in P-N vector angle
%from experiments measuring changes in $\alpha$-carbon order parameter. 
%\todo{SAMULI: I think that we should establish the relation between 
%order parameter and P-N vector angle changes by using ECC-lipids model.
%This would be useful for people measuring aplha order parameter
%changes from experiments.}
%
%For example, $\Delta S_{\rm CH}^{\alpha}=0.018$ measured due to the
%addition of 66.8 $\mu$M concentration of Mellittin in bulk water \cite{kuchinka89}
%gives $\Delta \Theta_{\rm P-N} = 2.5^{\circ}$.

\end{figure}


Changes of the lipid bilayer headgroup order parameters from different simulations and
experiments \cite{akutsu81,altenbach84} are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl} and~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_NaCl}
as functions of NaCl or CaCl$_2$ concentrations.
%Responses to NaCl concentrations are in SI, Fig.~S\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_NaCl}.
These results can be used to compare the ion binding affinities to lipid bilayers
between simulations and experiments using the electrometer concept, because 
the order parameters decrease proportionally 
to the amount of the bound positive charge (Fig.~\ref{OrderParameterCHANGESsurf} and Ref.~\citenum{seelig87,catte16}). 
A recent comparison of different simulation models to the experimental data
revealed that most force fields significantly overestimate Na$^+$ ion binding to PC
lipid bilayers and that none of the available models correctly reproduces
the details of the binding of Ca$^{2+}$ ions \cite{catte16}.
The only exception in Ref.~\citenum{catte16} was the Lipid14 model \cite{dickson14} simulated with \AA{}qvist ions,
which reproduced the experimentally measured 
small order parameter changes with NaCl (Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_NaCl})
and the negligible Na$^+$ binding to PC bilayers \cite{akutsu81,altenbach84}.
However, the change of the headgroup order parameters as a function of CaCl$_2$ concentration 
(Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl}) was still grosly overestimated within this model.

Since artifacts were reported in simulations with \AA{}qvist ions is water \cite{auffinger07},
we also simulated the Lipid14 model with more realistic ion models by Dang et al.~\cite{smith94,chang1999,dang2006}, and
ECC-ions~\cite{jungwirth17-new-paper-to-be-published, Pluharova2014}. 
However, we still observed overestimated binding for both \ce{Ca^{2+}} and Na$^+$ with these ions models 
(Figs.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl} and~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_NaCl}). 
The results are in line with the previous work \cite{catte16},
suggesting that additional improvements in the lipid parameters are
required to correctly describe the binding of cations to phospholipid bilayers.

%To improve the cation binding behaviour to POPC lipid bilayer we implicitly included the electronic
%polarization to the Lipid14 model by using the ECC approach as described in section \ref{section:ecc}.
The results from the simulations combining the ECC-lipids with the ECC-ion models \cite{jungwirth17-new-paper-to-be-published, kohagen16, Pluharova2014}
exhibit a significanlty improved behavior of cation binding to the POPC bilayer in Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl},
showing a good agreement with experiments in the changes of 
the lipid headgroup order parameters as functions of NaCl or CaCl$_2$ concentrations.
Since also the headgroup order parameter
response of the ECC-lipids model the to the bound positive charge 
is in good agreement with experiment (see above section \ref{section:boundCHARGE}),
we can conclude that this model correctly reproduces the binding affinities of
Na$^{+}$ and Ca$^{2+}$ ions to the POPC lipid bilayer.

In addition, while the response of the glycerol backbone $g_3$ order parameter to CaCl$_2$ was
signifincantly overestimated in the original Lipid14 model, the ECC-lipids model
provides a greatly improved agreement with experiment, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl}.
Also the changes of the P-N vector angle are too pronounced
for the Lipid14 model, for which the largest tilting toward water phase 
induced by a $780\,\mathrm{mM}$ CaCl$_2$ concentration
is approximately 17$^{\circ}$, while the corresponding
value for ECC-lipids model is only 6$^{\circ}$ ($820\,\mathrm{mM}$ CaCl$_2$).

Within the Lipid14 model, 
the overestimated changes in the lipid headgroup order parameter of POPC  as functions of the CaCl$_2$ concentration arise both from the overestimated
binding affinity and the too strong sensitivity of the headgroup tilt to the bound positive charge.
This likely applies also to the other lipid models tested in a previous study~\cite{catte16},
which underlines the importance of the comparison of the lipid headgroup order parameter response
to the bound charge between simulations and experiments as presented in section \ref{section:boundCHARGE}.

Finally, the ion binding affinities for the ECC-lipids model with different water models are compared in SI. 
In general, the performance of ECC-lipids with any of the water models 
is better than that of the original Lipid14 model, with the order parameter changes being slightly overestimated
with the four-site water models and with TIP3p model.

Binding affinities of Ca$^{2+}$ ions to a POPC bilayer in different simulation 
models were quantified by calculating the relative surface excess of calcium with respect to water molecules, $\Gamma_{\rm Ca}^w$, from Eq.~\ref{surfexcess}.
%using the bulk concentrations determined from the density profiles in Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl-dens}. 
The values of $\Gamma_{\rm Ca}^w$, shown in Table~\ref{tab:binding},
were calculated from simulations with the same concentration of CaCl$_2$ of $350\,\mathrm{mM}$  with 
respect to water before solvating the lipids.
As expected from the changes of the lipid headgroup order parameters in Fig. \ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl}, 
the relative surface excess for the ECC-lipids model, $\Gamma_{\rm Ca}^w = (0.06 \pm 0.01) \rm{nm}^{-2}$,
is significantly smaller than for the Lipid14 model with \AA{}qvist ions, $\Gamma_{\rm Ca}^w = (0.13 \pm 0.01) \rm{nm}^{-2}$,
or with Dang ions, $\Gamma_{\rm Ca}^w = (0.23 \pm 0.03) \rm{nm}^{-2}$,
or with ECC-ions,  $\Gamma_{\rm Ca}^w (0.35 \pm 0.11) \rm{nm}^{-2}$,
where the large uncertainity arises from a too small simulation box (Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl-dens}).
Interestingly, the relative surface excess of 
\ce{NaCl} at $1\,\mathrm{M}$ concentration (ECC-ions~\cite{Pluharova2014}) 
%calculated using density profiles in Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl-dens}
is not only quantitatively but also qualitatively different from \ce{CaCl2}
having a negative value $\Gamma_i^w = (-0.11 \pm 0.01) \rm{nm}^{-2}$ 
meaning that water molecules are preferred to sodium and chloride ions at the membrane-water interface. 
This is in contrast to the most of the available lipid force fields,
which predict a positive binding of sodium to
PC lipid bilayers \cite{catte16}.

%, phosphate and carbonyl oxygens.  
%This is in line with the calculated negative value of

%their density profiles along the membrane normal (Fig.~\ref{fig:nacl-dens})
%suggesting that the populations of bound sodium cations 
%naturally decrease with the decreasing density of water. 

In conclusion, the results suggest that calcium ions bind specifically to phosphate
oxygens, occasionally interacting also with carbonyls. This is in good agreement
with previous conclusions from several experimental and computational
studies~\cite{hauser76,hauser78,herbette84,cevc90,binder02}, but
suggesting a lower relative binding affinity to the carbonyls than inferred from previous MD simulation
studies~\cite{bockmann03,bockmann04,melcrova16,javanainen17}.
Sodium ions also interact primarily with phosphate oxygens of the POPC, 
but in contrast to calcium, the interactions purely with carbonyls are also significant.
The physiological relevance of these details of sodium interactions is, however, unclear
due to its overall very weak binding affinity.

\subsection{Binding stoichiometry of \ce{Na+} and \ce{Ca^{2+}} cations to the POPC membrane}

%Binding probability:
%\ce{Ca2+} complex with \\
%1 POPC - 13\% -- 30\% \\
%2 POPC - 18\% -- 42\% \\
%3 POPC - 12\% -- 28\% \\

Simple binding models have been used previously to interpret
the same experimental data \cite{altenbach84,macdonald87} 
that are used in this work to validate the simulation models in Fig. \ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl}.
Results from measurements of the lipid headgroup order parameters and from
atomic absorption spectroscopy were best
explained by a ternary complex binding model with a binding
stoichiometry of one \ce{Ca^{2+}} per two POPC lipids~\cite{altenbach84}.
However, a Langmuir adsorption model (i.e. \ce{Ca^{2+}}:POPC stoichiometry of 1:1) 
also provided a good fit to the experimental data when only low concentrations of \ce{CaCl2} were considered~\cite{macdonald87}.
Note that the results based on these binding models and the measured headgroup order parameter changes
are also inluded in the tabulated experimental binding constants~\cite{marsh13}.

Since the same experimental data are reproduced by the present ECC-lipids model,
we can use the model to provide a more detailed interepration of the binding stoichiometry than
the previously used simple binding models~\cite{altenbach84,macdonald87}. To directly evaluate the
stoichiometry from simulations we calculated the relative propensities of \ce{Ca^{2+}}:POPC
complexes with various stoichiometries by counting the individual lipid
molecules within the distance $0.3\,\mathrm{nm}$ from each \ce{Ca^{2+}} ion,
as already done in the previous section~\ref{sec:affinity}.
The results from POPC simulation with a 285~mM concetration of CaCl$_2$ in
Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl_complexes} demonstrate the largest propensity (41\%) for the
ternary complex with the \ce{Ca^{2+}}:POPC stoichiometry of 1:2, but 
the probabilities of complexes with the stoichimetries of 1:1~(25\%)~and
1:3~(34\%)~are only slightly lower. This
suggests a more complex binding model than the previous simple ternary complex model.
%The observed propensities of
%$41\%$ for two lipids,
%$25\%$ for one lipid, and
%$34\%$ for three lipids 
With a broad brushstroke, the simulation data can, however, be viewed such that
one calcium binds to two lipids on average,
because the probabilities of the complexes with 1 or 3 lipids are almost equal to each other 
(and complexes with more than three lipids per one calcium ion were not observed).  
This probably explains why the simple the ternary complex model fits the
experimental data, as well as the ECC-lipids simulation results, rather well
(see Fig.~S\ref{fig:cacl-bind} in SI and its caption for details).

The probabilities of different complexes formed by \ce{Na+} ions and POPC
analyzed from the simulation with the ECC-lipids model at $1\,$M concentration of NaCl are also 
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl_complexes}. In contrast to calcium, the
probability is largest (67\%) for 1:1 complex, significantly smaller (29\%)
for 1:2 complexes and very small (4\%) for 1:3 of \ce{Na+}:POPC complexes.




\subsection{Residence times of \ce{Na+} and \ce{Ca^{2+}} cations in POPC membrane}

Equilibration of \ce{Ca^{2+}} ions at the POPC bilayer takes hundreds of
nanoseconds in MD simulations with current state of the art force fields,
e.g. CHARMM36 and Slipids force fields~\cite{javanainen17}, suggesting that
simulations at a temporal scale of several microseconds are required
to reach the binding/unbinding equilibrium. 
This is in line with the density profiles of \ce{Ca^{2+}} 
from simulations in Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl-dens}, 
which all show a region of a very small calcium density 
around the level of cholines in POPC (i.e. around $2.5\,\mathrm{nm}$).
In contrast, simulations with  ECC-lipids 
exhibits only a relatively shallow local
minimum at that level.
This suggests that the smaller barrier for the exchange of calcium ions 
shall lead to their faster exchange with the solvent within ECC-lipids.
To quantify the exchange of ions between the membrane and solvent in simulations, we thus calculated 
residence times of ions bound to the membrane.
We use the same definition for ions bound to the membrane as in the above section~\ref{sec:affinity},
i.e., an ion is considered as bound if it is within 0.3~nm from any oxygen atom
belonging to a lipid molecule in a bilayer.

The histograms of residence times of \ce{Ca^{2+}} in a POPC bilayer 
at a $450\,\mathrm{mM}$ concentration of \ce{CaCl_2} in water before adsorption to phospholipids
from simulations with ECC-lipids 
compared to CHARMM36 (taken from previous study \cite{javanainen17}, 
simulation data available at Ref.~\citenum{zenodo.259376})
are shown in Fig.~S\ref{fig:hist_residence_times} in SI. 
%Based on Fig. S17 in that work, Ref.~\citenum{javanainen17},
%we took the simulation with the apparent highest fluctuations of the number of bound calcium,
%which can be obtained at \url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.259376}
%and anaylsed the residence times.
In the CHARMM36 simulation, approximately 20\% of the \ce{Ca^{2+}} residence times are longer than
the whole length of the trajectory ($800\,\mathrm{ns}$).
Within such a relatively short simulation, 
we can only estimate that 
less than 60\% of the bound residence times 
is due to cations interacting with the phospholipid membrane 
for less then half of the simulation length~(400~ns).
Even longer residence times are observed
in  simulations with CHARMM36 and Slipids models reported in previous works~\cite{javanainen17}.

In contrast, at least an order of magnitude faster bound/unbound calcium exchange is observed within the
ECC-lipids model, where 90\% of the \ce{Ca^{2+}} residence times to a POPC membrane are 
shorter than $60\,\mathrm{ns}$, % exactly $53\,\mathrm{ns}$.
The longest observed residence time is now $141\,\mathrm{ns}$, 
which is well below the total length of the simulation used for analysis, i.e., 200~ns.
The exchange of \ce{Na+} ions at the POPC membrane is
another order of magnitude faster, yielding 90\%
of the residence times smaller than~$1\,\mathrm{ns}$, with
the longest residence time being~$6\,\mathrm{ns}$. 
\todo{Joe: the following is a bit more subtle argument. 
I deem it not necessary to include it in the paper, however, 
the experimental estimate of less tan 10us holds likely also for Charmm36/ECC-ions, as stated before.}
Note that the ECC-lipids calcium results are in line with the experimental estimate that 
the residence time of \ce{Ca^{2+}} at each individual PC headgroup 
is shorter than $10\,\mu\mathrm{s}$~\cite{altenbach84}.

%give a roughly estimate of the order
%of $1\,\mu\mathrm{s}$
%This is unfortunately not the case of many theoretical works,
%where the residence time cannot be estimated,
%or the simulation has not even decorrelated from it's 
%initial condition with a population of bound/unbound cations \cite{catte16}, 
%because it is limited by the simulation length, 
%even though it can be very long (order of $\mu\mathrm{s}$) in some works, e.g. reference~\citenum{javanainen17}. 
%Increasing time scales to the order of $\mu\mathrm{s}$ 
%doesn't help to alleviate such a problem in current lipid models \cite{javanainen17}. %and also \cite{catte16}, but same simulation was used. 

In conclusion, the results from the ECC-lipids model suggest that the
exchange of calcium between the POPC bilayer and the solvent occurs within $\sim 100\,$ns timeframe,
which is significantly faster than previously reported~\cite{javanainen17}.
Sodium cations exhibit an even a faster exchange.
This all suggests that simulations with a length of a several hundreds of
nanoseconds are sufficient to simulate ion binding
to phospholipid bilayers in equilibrium, when realistic force fields are used.
This has not been the case with previous lipid force fields,
which overestimate the binding strength of the sodium and calcium cations \cite{javanainen17,catte16}.
%Such a finding changes the point of view on binding of calcium to PC membranes from
%a very strong long-term stable binding with rare exchanges to 
%a relatively frequent exchange of clacium cations 
%in equilibrium between membrane and solvent. 








\section{Conclusions}

In this study, we employed the electrometer concept to demonstrate that the binding of \ce{Na^+} and \ce{Ca^2+} ions
to a POPC lipid bilayer can be accurately described within a classical MD simulation 
force field, provided that electronic polarization is implicitly included via 
the electronic continuum correction~\cite{leontyev11}.
While the structural details of a POPC lipid bilayer simulated with the newly developed ECC-lipids
model agree with experiments with an accuracy comparable to the other state of the art lipid models,
the model also reproduces the experimental lipid head group order parameter responses to
a cationic surfactant, NaCl and CaCl$_2$ concentrations. 
It thus represents a significant improvement over 
other available lipid models, which overestimate cation binding affinities~\cite{catte16}.  
The ECC-lipids model is build upon
the Lipid14 POPC model~\cite{dickson14} by scaling the partial charges by a factor of 0.8
and reducing the Van der Waals radii by a factor of 0.89 for the headgroup, glycerol backbone and carbonyl atoms. 

The good agreement with experiments enables us to 
interpret NMR experiments with atomistic details using MD simulations with the ECC-lipid model.
In line with previous interpretations of experimental data \cite{hauser76,hauser78,herbette84,binder02},
Ca$^{2+}$ ions interact mainly with phosphate oxygens.
However, the stoichiometry of calcium binding is significantly more complicated than
the simple ternary complex model, used to interpret NMR data, where one calcium binds to two POPC molecules~\cite{altenbach84}.
While complexes with one calcium ion bound to two lipids are the most probable also in the
ECC-lipids model, complexes of one or three lipids per one calcium
were observed to relatively abundant and also almost equally likely. While the success of the simple ternary
compex model in fitting NMR data is understandable based on the simulation results,
it cannot capture the complex nature of calcium binding to phospholipid bilayers
oberved in the present simulation.

Accurate description of cation binding to POPC bilayer paves the way for
simulations of complex biochemical systems at cellular membranes with realistically described
electrostatic interactions. To this end, the compatibility of
the ECC-lipids model with existing models for proteins and other biological molecules should to be verified and, if necessary, 
further adjustments along the ECC concept in force fields of molecules interacting with the lipids need to be done.

%but we expect that the correction can be used also for other lipids
%and force fields.

%We suggest using state of the art water models like OPC3\cite{Izadi16} or OPC \cite{Izadi14},
%which yield higher accuracy than the traditional TIP3p water model~\cite{jorgensen83}.
%Several water models 
%(OPC3\cite{Izadi16}, OPC \cite{Izadi14}, SPC/E \cite{Berendsen1987} and TIP4p/2005 \cite{Abascal2005}) 
%were used to exemplify the transferability of 
%the parameters of the new ECC-lipids force field.

{\bf SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION}
\end{center}

It was found in the original work~\cite{altenbach84} that 
a ternary complex binding model (i.e.~2~POPC:1~\ce{Ca^{2+}})
provides the best fit to experimental measurements of all considered models in that study. 
In such a model, there is a linear relationship between quantities 
$C_b$, mole fraction of bound \ce{Ca^{2+}} per POPC, and $\sqrt{C_b/C_I}$, 
where $C_I$ is the concentration of free cations at the plane of ion binding~\cite{altenbach84}.
The concentration $C_b$ was obtained from an extrapolation of linear relation 
between deuterium NMR measurements and atomic absorption spectroscopy for low concetrations of \ce{CaCl2}.
Such an extrapolation is valid as long as the mode of \ce{Ca^{2+}} binding 
remains constant throughout the extrapolation range. 
The concentration $C_I$ is determined from the surface potential using the Boltzmann equation.
However, Boltzmann theory yields inaccurate results
for divalent cations like \ce{Ca^{2+}}~\cite{Andelman1995}. 
An atomistic simulation, on the other hand, provides these quantities directly without severe assumptions;
$C_b$ can be calculated from simulation using the robust definition in section~\ref{sec:affinity},
and $C_I$ can be obtained from the density profiles in Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl-density} 
as the minimum concentration at the shallow depression separating the bulk water phase 
and the peak of adsorbed cations around 2.6\,nm from the membrene centre. 
The small discrepancy between the results in the experiment~\cite{altenbach84} and 
our simulations are likely caused by the difference in the evaluation of the concentrations.

    provides a good fit to experimental measurements~\cite{altenbach84}
    and it also provides a good fit to our simulation data. 
    This supports our statement that the success of the ternary complex model in the experiments
    can be understood with the atomistic detail of our simulations as an average 
    stoichiometry of otherwise almost evenly distributed clusters of one cation with 1,2 or 3 lipids (Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl_complexes}). 
    Note that the units in the reference~\citenum{altenbach84} are different from the units presented here,
    and, hence, the observed slope of the linear relationship is slightly different.
