Classical molecular dynamics simulations give detailed information about membrane structure and dynamics. 
However, there is still a room for improvements in current force fields â€“ it is known from the literature,
that the binding of ions, especially cations, to phopholipid membranes is overestimated in all classical models [1]. 
We suggest that the membrane-ion interactions can be corrected by including implicit electronic polarizability into the
lipid models through the electronic continuum correction (ECC) [2], which was already applied to monovalent and divalent
ions yielding models that feature correct ion pairing [3]. 
Using the electrometer concept [3, 4] and x-ray scattering form factors, our simulations point out that our hypothesis is
correct and ECC is indeed a missing important contribution in current classical lipid models. 
Moreover, the solid physical principles behind ECC are found not to hamper other relevant properties of a phospholipid bilayer. 
The new lipid model, "ECC-lipids", shows accurate binding affinity to sodium and calcium cations and head group order parameter response to bound charge. 
We also provide for the first time a realistic stochiometry of bound calcium cations to a POPC membrane, and their binding sites. 
This work will continue as an open collaboration project NMRlipids VI (http://nmrlipids.blogspot.fi).

\section{Introduction}
Cation interactions with cellular membranes play a key role in several biological processes,
like in signal propagation in neurons and vesicle fusion.
\todo{JOE: list more introductory examples, where it has interesting effects.}
Zwitterionic phosphocholine (PC) lipid bilayers have been widely used as model systems
to understand molecular level details of specific cation interactions with
cellular membranes by using experimental \cite{cevc90,tocanne90,binder02,pabst07,uhrikova08}
and theoretical methods \cite{bockmann03,bockmann04,Berkowitz12,??} 
\todo{PAVEL: introduce previous theoretical work that discusses cation binding to POPC w.r.t. its specific moiteties, e.g. Lukas' paper}.
While relative binding affinity of different ions is agreed to follow Hoffmeister
series, the molecular details of binding and binding energetics are
not agreed in the literature \cite{cevc90,tocanne90,seelig90,binder02,catte16,??}.
%General conclusion from experimental
%studies has been that multivalent ions and lithium have weak specific binding in
%phopholipid bilayers, while other monovalent ions do not essentially
%bind 
%The presence of anoinic lipids, like PS or PG,
%increase the concentration close to the bilayer and thus the amount of bound
%ions, but do not affect the specific binding constant \cite{seelig90}.
Non-invansive spectroscopic methods, like nucelar magnetic resosnance (NMR), scattering
and infrared scpectroscopy, give accurate information about ion binding
in lipid bilayers\cite{hauser76,hauser78,herbette84,akutsu81,altenbach84,binder02}. 
Molecular level interpretation of the results, however, requires assumptions
about binding models and is often not fully conclusive \cite{??}.
On the other hand, the accuracy of the state of the art atomistic resolution lipid and ion models
have turned out insufficient for the detailed interpretation of cation binding details \cite{catte16}.
The overestimated specific cation binding observed in current lipid models \cite{catte16}
may lead to articifially positively charged memranes and significant artefacts in
MD simualtions (e.g.~divalent cation-induced charge inversion of bacterial membranes~\cite{Luan2016}
\todo{JOE: this may be a too daring statement. \\
  SAMULI: I think that the divalent cation induced charge inversion is not an artefact,
  but it might happen with too small concentrations. 
  On the other hand, it is not a new observation either, see e.g. literature cited in NMRlipids IV project.}). 

%The binding details, like binding sites and stoichiometry are not yet fully
%resolved but interpretation of NMR and scattering experiments suggest that one
%Ca2+ interacts mainly with the choline groups \cite{hauser76,hauser78,herbette84} of two
%phospholipid molecules \cite{altenbach84}.

In this work we show that the accuracy of ion binding, especially calcium,
in zwitterionic PC lipid bilayer can be significantly improved 
for classical MD simulation models of zwitterionic lipids
by including electronic polarizability
in the polar region of lipid molecules
using the electronic continuum correction (ECC)~\cite{leontyev11}. 
This approach has been previously shown to improve performace of
ion models against neutron scattering data in concentrated solutions 
and ab-initio simulations~\cite{Jungwirth2017,Jungwirth2015,kohagen14,kohagen16}. 
The realistic structure of ions in a bulk solvent was not, however, sufficient to correct binding in lipid
bilayers~\cite{catte16}. 
To fix it, we propose
a classical fixed-charge MD simulation model of 
1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) lipid 
that accounts for electronic polarizability by using ECC. 
We will validate such a model by comparing its lipid bilayer structue
to x-ray scattering data and its head group structure to NMR experiments. 
We will then quantify the accuracy of the head group order parameter response to the bound charge
and compare it to the experimental NMR data of sodium and calcium binding in PC lipid bilayers. 
In addition, we will quantify relative binding affinities of different moieties in POPC to such cations. 
This will be discussed in terms of binding modes, stoichiometry and binding isotherms and their models used in experiments.
The proposed POPC model, ECC-lipids, and the approach to obtain it
is, hence, highly useful for future MD simulations with physiological salt conditions, 
and for effects where membrane electrostatics play a major role.




\section{Methods}

\subsection{Electronic continuum correction for lipid bilayers}\label{section:ecc}
The lack of electronic polarizability in the standard MD simulation
force fields has been considered higly relevant issue since the early days of
lipid bilayer simulations.
%Some pioneering simulation studies scaled
%the partial charges of atoms by one half to effectively include 
%polarizability \cite{jonsson86,egberts94}. Also, approaches that
%explicitly include polarizability has been introduced, but
%this has turned out to be practically complicated \cite{chowdhary13}.
In this work we circumvent the rather demanding explicit inclusion
of electronic polariization effects \cite{chowdhary13} by implicitly including
electronic polarizability in lipid
bilayer simulations by using the electronic continuum correction
(ECC)~\cite{leontyev11}. 
Technically, it is a similar approach to the phenomenological charge-scaling as applied in 
the early studies where a scaling factor one half was used \cite{jonsson86,egberts94}. 
However, the concept of ECC is 
physically well justified and rigorously derived~\cite{leontyev09, leontyev10, leontyev11},
but significantly more simple than the explicit inclusion of electronic
polarizability \cite{chowdhary13} both for derivation and application.


According to ECC, electronic
polarizability can be included in classical MD simulations by
placing all particles into a homogeneous dielectric continuum 
with a dielectric constant $\epsilon _{el}$, 
which is the electronic part of the dielectric constant of 
the media \cite{leontyev11}. Measurements of high frequency 
dielectric constant gives values of approximately $\epsilon _{el} \approx 2$ 
for almost any biomaterial \cite{some_original_work, leontyev11}.
Such a dielectric continuum can be easily included in standard MD simulation by
a formal transformation of partial charges 
\begin{equation}
  Q^{ECC} = f_q \cdot Q
\end{equation}
with a constant scaling factor $f_q = \epsilon _{el} ^{-1/2}$ 
effectively representing the newly introduced electronic continuum. 
The value measured for water, $\epsilon _{el} = 1.78$, gives 
a scaling factor of $f_q = 0.75$ \cite{some_orig_source, leontyev11}, which has been
successfully used to improve the performance of force field for ions \cite{kohagen14,kohagen16,??}. 

While the scaling factor of $f_q = 0.75$ for ions in water is well justified and 
improves the model performance against experimental scattering data \cite{kohagen14,kohagen16, Pluharova2014},
it is not clear if the same factor should be used for partial charges in molecules,
i.e, lipids in our case. 
Unlike the total charge of molecules, atomic partial charges within each molecule are not experimental observables.
Although there have been proposed several schemes for the assignment of partial charges of molecules, 
methods targetting at fitting of electrostatic potentials are 
most popular among classical fixed charge force fields for biomolecules. \cite{Hu2007}
Currently the most commonly employed scheme is the RESP scheme~\cite{RESP_paper,Singh1984}, 
which fits the electrostatic potential from quantum mechanical calculations. 
The resulting set of fixed partial atomic charges is hence 
the best fit to electrostatic potentials of 
an ensemble of conformations of a molecule. 
Such a physical meaning is especially well suited for the application of ECC, 
which targets at improving electrostatic interactions. 
Depending to the details, partial charge calculations may also partially
include some of the solvent electronic polarizability effects. 
Thus, we expect that
the correct ECC scaling factor, $f_q$, for molecular partial charges
does not have to be striclty $f_q = \epsilon _{el} ^{-1/2}$, 
but rather lies between this value (no electronic polarizability in the charge calculation)
and $1$ (full electronic polarizability already included in the charge calculation).
%
% This is not really important for the paper:
%
%However, the RESP method has several remedies;  %and these are specific to RESP
%RESP charges show a dependence on the orientation and position
%and it does not provide numerically stable partial charges of burried atoms;~\cite{Hu2007}
%the RESP-derived values depend, for example, on the conformational
%sampling of the molecules and description of solvent 
%in the calculations~\cite{RESP_paper, Singh1984, Hu2007, maciejewski14}. 
%
%Hirshfeld-E partitioning: \cite{Verstraelen2013}
%In cases where the partial charges have some physical meaning 
%(e.g. approximate electrostatic potential as in RESP~~\cite{RESP_paper,Singh1984}),
%
%

In this work, we empirically sample this parameter space $f_q \in [0.75, 1.0]$
to find an atomistic MD simulation force field parameters for lipids that
accurately describe the lipid head group response to varying concentrations of cations
when compared to NMR data \cite{akutsu81,altenbach84,scherer89}. Such data can be used to accurately asses
ion binding in PC bilayers, as discussed in Ref, \citenum{catte16} and in section \ref{section:electrometer}.
We chose Lipid14~\cite{dickson14} force field parameters as a starting point,
because their response to bound ions was apparently most realistic against NMR data
in recent work by NMRlipids project (see Fig.~5 in Ref.~\citenum{catte16}).
Also glycerol backbone and head group structures in Lipid14 model were
relatively realistic when compared with other state of the art lipid models \cite{botan15}.
The ECC correction was applied to Lipid14 parameters by scaling partial charges of the headgroup,
glycerol backbone and carbonyl regions, which are the most polar parts in lipids and
are expected to have the largest contribution to the cation binding.
The hydrocarbon chain parameters are not modified, because they are
already highly optimized and give generally a good description for
hydrophobic part of lipid bilayers in various conditions
in most lipids models, including Lipid14 \cite{ollila16}.
In contrast, improvements in glycerol backbone and headgroup
parameters are required in all available lipid models~\cite{botan15}. 

Exploring different scaling factor values, applied to headgroup, glycerol backbone
and carbonyl charges of Lipid14 model, we found out that ion binding and
related headgroup order parameter responses become weaker. 
The optimal behaviour of ion binding was observed with
the scaling factor $f_q = 0.8$. % is optimal for applying ECC on Lipid14 model. 
Interestingly, this scaling factor is in line with the estimate
given by ``implicitly polarized charges'' (IPolQ) \cite{ipolq2013}
combined with RESP calculations in vacuum and implicit solvent reported
in \cite{maciejewski14}. IPolQ charges are obtained as the average of
partial charges given by RESP calculation~\cite{RESP_paper}
in vacuum and in a solvent. Applying the scaling factor of 0.75 to
IPolQ charges calculated from the data in Ref.~\cite{maciejewski14},
gives similar partial charges to ones obtained by scaling Lipid14 charges
with a factor 0.8.
%-----\footnote----------
  %{Depending on which QM method you arrive at values from 0.76 to 0.83, averages across atom
  %types being around 0.78--0.80. Even though the methods are almost identical, authors of Lipid 14 find lower
  %partial charges in vacuum than here -- so I prefer the higher value. As the choice of charges is arbitrary anyway,
  %I use 0.80 as an approximate round value, which accounts for the already lower charges in Lipid14. 
  %The use of 0.78---.79 might be more appropriate, though.}


While, the charge scaling improved the behaviour of lipid-ion interactions,
it reduced the area per molecule of lipid bilayer without ions below experimental
values. Simulations with Lipid14 parameters having partial charges of headgroup, glycerol
backbone and carbonyls scaled with 0.8 gave the area per molecule value of $\approx$60~\AA$^2$,
which is significantly smaller than the experimental value 64.3~\AA$^2$ (\cite{}\todo{missing REF for APL experiment})
and the original Lipid14 value $(65.6 \pm 0.5)$~\AA$^2$~\cite{dickson14}.
The decrease of area was found to arise from a lower hydration of the lipid head group region,
which can be explained by the decreased solvation free energy due to the lower polarity
of molecules with scaled charges. The hydration can be increased
by reducing the effective radius of atoms by changing the 
the $\sigma$ parameters in Lennard-Jones potential for the selected atoms
similarly as done for free ions in solution \cite{kohagen14,kohagen16,Pluharova2014}.
This increases solvation free energy by allowing water molecules to
approach closer to lipid atoms and have stonger electrostatic interactions with them.
After reducing the $\sigma$ parameters with a factor of $f_\sigma = 0.89$
for the same atoms for which charges were scaled, the area per molecule value was
again in agreement with experimental value (see Table~\ref{tab:apls}). 


\subsection{Comparison of ion binding affinity to experiments by using the electrometer concept} \label{section:electrometer}
Ion binding was compared between experiments and simulations by 
using lipid head group order parameters and 
''electrometer concept'' \cite{seelig87,catte16}.
The concept is based on the experimental observation that the C-H bond
order parameters of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbons in lipid head group
(see Fig.~\ref{simVSexpNOions}) are proportional to the amount 
of bound charge in a lipid bilayer \cite{seelig87}.
This is rationalized as a change of lipid head group dipole tilt to more vertical orientation
with bound positive charge and {\it vice versa} for negative charge \cite{seelig87}. 
More recent analysis in the NMRlipids project concluded 
that the order parameters decrease with bound positive charge 
and increase with bound negative charge when the signs are taken 
in account \cite{ollila16,catte16}. The concept was also shown
to be suitable for the comparison of ion binding affinity in lipid 
bilayers between simulations and experiments~\cite{catte16}.
 
The order parameters for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ segments in headgroup, as well as for
all C-H bonds in lipid molecules,
can be accurately measured by using $^2$H NMR or $^{13}$C NMR techniques.
The order parameters can be calculated from MD simulations 
by using the definition
\begin{equation}\label{OP}
S_{\rm CH}=\frac{3}{2}\langle \cos^2\theta -1 \rangle,
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the angle between the bond and membrane
normal and average is taken over all sampled configurations \cite{ollila16}.

According to the electrometer concept,
the change of the head group order parameters as a function of
the amount of bound charge per lipid $X^\pm$ 
can be written as~\cite{ferreira16}
\begin{equation}\label{OPchangeEQ}
\Delta S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}= S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}(X^\pm)-S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}(0) =\frac{4m_i }{3\chi}X^\pm,
\end{equation}
where $S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}(0)$ denote the order parameter in the absence of bound charge,
$i$ refers to either $\alpha$ or $\beta$ carbon,
%the empirically observed linear relation %for the change in order parameters %with respect to a bilayer without bound charges              
%\begin{equation}\label{electrometer_eq}                                                                                                   
%S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}(X^\pm)=S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}(0) + \frac{4m_i}{3\chi} X^\pm,                                                                     
%\end{equation}                                                                                                                            
$m_i$ is an empirical constant depending on the valency and position of bound charge,
and the value of the quadrupole coupling constant is $\chi \approx$\,167\,kHz.
Atomic absorption spectra and $^2$H NMR data gave
$m_\alpha=-20.5$  and $m_\beta=-10.0$ for Ca$^{2+}$ binding to POPC
bilayer (in the presence of 100~mM NaCl)~\cite{altenbach84,ollila16,catte16}.
Before using electrometer concept to analyze cation binding, 
we calibrate the response of headgroup order parameters to the bound
charge in the simulation models. This is done by comparing 
the slope $m_i$ in Eq. \ref{OPchangeEQ} between simulations and
experiments of cationic surfactants in POPC bilayer \cite{scherer89}. 
Since essentially all surfactants locate in bilayer, the 
molar ratio directly gives the amount of bound charge per 
lipid $X^\pm$ is these systems.

\subsection{Ion concentrations and binding affinity}
The experimental headgroup order parameter data used
in this work is reported as a function of 
cation concentration remaining in the bulk 
solvent \cite{akutsu81,altenbach84}. 
To determine the same concentration from simulations, we
use large enough box to ensure that the ion concetration
reaches a clear plateau and the electroneutrality
is satisfied at the edge of simulation box. It should be noted that the recent work
by NMRlipids project compared simulations to the same 
experimental data by using the relative molar concentration in water
[salt]=N$_{\rm c} \times$[water]\,/\,N$_{\rm w}$, where [water]\,=\,55.5~M \cite{catte16}.
This is not exactly the same as the concentration reported in the used experimental
data, because the binding of ions in bilayer reduces the bulk concentration.
The difference slightly moves points towards lower concentrations but do not 
affect the conclusions in the previous study \cite{catte16}. 

The ion binding affinities between different models were compared by calculating
the relative surface excess of ions with respect to water, $\Gamma_i^w$, as \cite{chattorajBOOK}
\begin{eqnarray}
  \Gamma_i^w   &=& \Gamma_i-\Gamma_w \frac{C_i-C_i'}{C_w-C_w'} \\
  \Gamma_{a} &=& \frac{n_{a} - C_{a} V - C_{a}' V'}{A} \, \, ; \, a=i,w \, ,
\end{eqnarray}
where index $i$ and $w$ denote ions and water respectively,
prime accent denotes the phase inside bilayer, 
whereas non-prime symbols account for bulk water phase,
$n$ is the total amount of water or ions,
$C$ denotes bulk concentrations, 
$V$ is the volume of the respective phase separated by the Gibbs divinding plane, 
$A$ is the area of the interface, 
and $\Gamma_a$ is the surface excess of water or ions. 
As $\Gamma_i^w$ does not depend on the definition of the interfacial region
and the position of the Gibbs dividing plane~\cite{chattorajBOOK},
we consider the whole simulation box as an interface. 
Note that phospholipid membranes are bilayers, 
and hence the interface occurs in the simulation box twice
providing a surface area $2A$.
The concentrations of water and ions inside
the bilayer can be expected to vanish, thus $c_{i,w}'=0$.
This provides us a simplified relation for 
the relative surface excess of lipid bilayers in simulations
\begin{equation}\label{surfexcess}
  \Gamma_i^w=\frac{1}{2A} \left ( n_i - n_w \frac{C_i}{C_w} \right ) ,
\end{equation}
where the bulk concentrations, $C_w$ and $C_i$, can be determined
from the concentration plateau at the edge of the simulation box.

\subsection{Comparison of lipid bilayer structure to experiments}

Lipid bilayer structure without ions was validated against NMR experiments
by order parameters for C-H bonds and \mbox{x-ray} scattering experiments by using
form factors. The former validates the structures sampled by individual
lipid molecules in simulations with segmental resolution, while the latter
validates the dimensions of the lipid bilayer (thickness and area per
molecule)~\cite{ollila16}.

The order parameters were calculated from simulations for all C-H bonds
in lipid molecule by using Eq. \ref{OP}. Form factors were calculated 
from equation
\begin{equation}
  F(q) = \int _{-D/2} ^{D/2} \left ( \sum _\alpha f_\alpha (q_z) n_\alpha (z) - \rho _s \right ) \exp (izq_z) \mathrm{d}z,
\end{equation}
where $f_\alpha(q_z)$ is the density of atomic scattering length, 
$\rho_s$ is the density of solvent scattering length,
$n_\alpha (z)$ is the number density of atom $\alpha$ and
$z$ is the distance from the membrane centre along its normal 
spanning the membrane with thickness $D$. 




\subsection{Simulation details}

\subsubsection{Simulations with aqueous ions}
The simulated systems consisted of 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine
(POPC) bilayer and an aqueous salt solutions of varying concentrations.
In particular, the periodic orthorhombic simulation box conatined 
128 POPC molecules and approximately 50~water molecules per each lipid.
Water molecules were described by OPC3 model~\cite{Izadi16} 
as it is currently the most accurate three site rigid water model. 
In order to test transferability of the newly developed ECC-lipids model, 
we also performed several additional simulations with water models 
OPC \cite{Izadi14}, SPC/E \cite{Berendsen1987}, TIP3p-FB and TIP4p-FB~\cite{Wang2014}, and TIP4p/2005 \cite{Abascal2005}
presented in Supporting Information (SI). 
We used ECC-ions model for ions \cite{jungwirth17-new-paper-to-be-published, kohagen16, Pluharova2014}.  % cite order: [Ca_2s, Na_s, Cl_2s]
Simulations with Lipid14 use ion models by Dang~\cite{smith94,chang1999,dang2006}, and by \AA{}qvist~\cite{aqvist90}. 
Classical molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the GROMACS \cite{Abraham15} simulation package (version 5.1.4).  
The simulation settings used in this work are 
summarized in Table \ref{tbl:mdpar}, 
and they are based on previously used settings in \cite{catte16} available at \cite{lipid14POPC0mMNaClfiles}.

\subsubsection{Simulations with cationic surfactants}
Automated topology builder \cite{malde11} was first used to create the structure of
dihexadecyldimethylammonium bromide, C$_{12}$Cl$_{16}$$^+$N2C$_1$Br$^-$, molecule.
AmberTools program \cite{amber} was then used to generate the Amber-type force field
parameters. The parameters were converted to the Gromacs format by using
acpype tool \cite{acpype}. The partial charges were then manually modified
to approximately correspond to their equivalent segments in Lipid14 \cite{dickson14}.
The surfactants were randomly placed among the lipids to form bilayer structures with
mole fractions 10\%, 20\%, 30\%, 42\% and 50\% of surfactant in the POPC bilayer.
All systems contained 50 POPC molecules per leaflet, 6340 TIP3P water molecules and
6, 14, 21, 35 or 50 surfactants per leaflet.
The systems were simulated for 200~ns using Lipid14 model for POPC.
First 20~ns was omitted from the analysis. 

The same systems were also simulated with ECC-lipid model for POPC \todo{How long?}.
In these simulations the ECC correction was also applied to the cationic surfactant 
by scaling all \todo{Were all scaled? Are there charges is tails? Were those scaled as well in this case?} 
charges with the same factor as for ECC-lipids, $f_q=0.8$,

In order to validate the newly developed model, ECC-lipids, 
we compared our simulation results without any ions to
NMR order parameters measurements and x-ray scattering form factors 
(Fig.~\ref{simVSexpNOions} and Table~\ref{tab:apls}). 
The tail order parameters being already highly optimized in the original Lipid14 model~\cite{dickson14}
are found to match the experimental values nicely.
The head group and glycerol backbone order parameters accuracy is 
comparable to the state of art lipid models available in literature \cite{ollila16}.
The agreement between the x-ray scattering form factors and the areas per molecule from simulations and experiments
confirm that the membrane structural properties are well captured. 
A structural comparison of ECC-lipids with Lipid14 can be found 
in SI along with results with other water models. 
%The optimal value for $f_\sigma$ was found by representing the overall membrane structure well
%by matching scattering form factors to experimental data~\cite{Petrache06, Kucerka08, Pabst10}.

\subsection{Response of POPC headgroup to bound charge}

Before proceeding to ion binding affinity studies, we quantify
the response of headgroup order parameters to the amount of 
bound charge by using mixtures of monovalent cationic surfactants
and POPC~\cite{scherer89}. The amount of bound charge per PC 
in these systems is 
given by the molar fraction of cationic surfactants, because essentially all surfactants 
locate in the lipid bilayers. Comparison of headgroup order parameter
changes between simulations and experiments 
as a function of mole fraction of cationic surfactants 
can be then used to validate the sensitivity of
lipid headgroup to bound charge in simulation models.

%depends on both, the
%binding affinity and the response of the headgroup on bound charge.
%Thus, the headgroup response to bound charge has to be correctly
%described in the model if the concept is used for quantitative studies of
%binding affinity. Hence, we first quantify the response of head group order
%parameters to the bound charge by using experimental data measured from
%mixtures of cationinc surfactants and PC lipids~\cite{scherer89}.
%
%Thus, the headgroup order parameter response to bound charge can be first
%quantified aginst experimental data before proceeding to binding affinity studies.
%Headgroup order parameter response to the amount of bound charge can
%be quantified by using ionic surfactants with a known valency~\cite{scherer89}.
%All surfactants locate in lipid bilayers due to their amphiphilic nature,
%thus the exact amount of bound charge in the membrane is known in these systems.
%The headgroup order parameter changes as a function of bound charges can be then
%explicitly determined from such systems.

The headgroup order parameter changes as a function of mole fraction
of cationic surfactant dihexadecyldimethylammonium bromide (C$_{12}$Cl$_{16}$$^+$N2C$_1$Br$^-$) 
is compared between experiments~\cite{scherer89} and simulations in
Fig. \ref{OrderParameterCHANGESsurf}. 
Approximately linear decrease of the order parameters is observed
in simulations and experiments with increasing amount of cationic
surfactants up to mole fractions of $\sim$50\%,
as expected from Eq. \ref{OPchangeEQ}.
The slope is, however, too steep in Lipid14 model indicating that 
the headgroup order parameters are too sensitive to a bound charge.
The ECC-lipids model gives a slope in very good agreement with experiments
for the $\alpha$ segment, while the slope is slightly
underestimated for the $\beta$ segment.
%This has to be taken into account when interpreting the
%head group order parameter response to CaCl$_2$ concentration in Lipid14 model.
%observed in  Ref. \citenum{catte16}, see also Fig. \ref{OrderParameterCHANGESnewMODELS}.
%The present comparison of head group order parameter changes 
%suggests that the observed overestimated response of all models to 
%increasing CaCl$_2$ concentration in \cite{catte16} 
%can be explained at least in part by a high sensitivity of the head group order parameter response
%to the bound charge.
\todo{SAMULI: We could calculate the slopes from simulations, but I am not sure if
we would actually learn anything useful from this.}

Also the effect of bound cations on the
headgroup P-N vector angle with respect to the membrane normal
is shown in Fig.~\ref{OrderParameterCHANGESsurf}.
The headgroup orients more parallel to the membrane
normal with an increasing amount of bound cations, as expected~\cite{seelig87}. 
The orientation effect is more pronounced in Lipid14 model than 
in ECC-lipids model, which is in line with the order parameter 
results and reduced charge--dipole interactions in the ECC-lipid model.
Since the response of $\alpha$-order parameter is in very good agreement
with experiments in ECC-lipid model, we can suggest a relation between
order parameter and P-N vector angle changes. The data gives
$\Delta \Theta_{\rm P-N}=?? \Delta S_{\rm CH}$, which can be used
to estimate P-N vector angle changes from experimental results
for $\alpha$ order parameters. 
\todo{SAMULI: I think that we should establish the relation between 
order parameter and P-N vector angle changes by using ECC-lipids model.
This would be useful for people measuring aplha order parameter
changes from experiments.}


\subsection{Cation binding affinity in POPC}

\begin{figure*}[tbp]

  \includegraphics[width=16.0cm]{../Fig/OrdParChanges_NaCl_CaCl2.eps}
  \caption{\label{OrderParameterCHANGESnewMODELS}
    Changes of headgroup order parameters of POPC bilayer as a function of NaCl and CaCl$_2$ concentrations

  }
\end{figure*}

The linear decrease of the headgroup order parameters, quantified in previous 
section, can be used to measure the amount of bound aqueous cations in lipid 
bilayers~\cite{seelig87,catte16}. The headgroup order parameter response 
to NaCl and CaCl$_2$ concentrations from experiments (DPPC \cite{akutsu81} 
and POPC \cite{altenbach84}) and different simulation models for POPC
are shown in Fig. \ref{OrderParameterCHANGESnewMODELS}.
%The simulation results of Lipid14 with \AA{}qvist ions~\cite{aqvist90} (from Ref. \citenum{catte16})
%are shown together with the results from Lipid14 simulation
%with ions by Dang~\cite{smith94,chang1999,dang2006} and from ECC-lipids simulations with ECC-ions.

Experimentally NaCl has a negligible effect on the headgroup order parameters
with submolar concentrations due to the very weak binding of Na$^+$
in PC bilayers \cite{akutsu81,catte16}. 
While almost all the available simulation models overestimate cation
binding in PC lipids, the weak binding of Sodium ions was reproduced by
Lipid14 model when simulated with \AA{}qvist ions~\cite{catte16}.
However, the headgroup order parameter response to CaCl$_2$ concentration was
overestimated with the same combination of force field parameters~\cite{catte16}.
Changing to ion models by Dang et al.~\cite{smith94,chang1999,dang2006} or
ECC-ions~\cite{jungwirth17-new-paper-to-be-published, kohagen16, Pluharova2014}
with more realistic bulk behaviour were used did not improve the results
for the CaCl$_2$ interactions with Lipid14 model, as seen in 
in Figs. \ref{OrderParameterCHANGESnewMODELS} and \ref{??} (in SI), respectively.
\todo{Add OP-response of Lipid14+ECC-ions plot in SI}.
Together with extensive data in previous work \cite{catte16}, 
the results suggest that CaCl$_2$ binding behaviour in PC bilayers
cannot be corrected by only improving the ion models. 

Significant improvement is achieved when the developed ECC-lipid model 
is used together with ECC-ions. The headgroup order parameter changes
as a function of CaCl$_2$ concentration show a good agreement between
ECC-lipid model and experiments in Fig. \ref{OrderParameterCHANGESnewMODELS}.
As discussed in previous section, also the response of headgroup order
parameters to the bound charge is in good agreement with the experiments in this
model. Thus, we conclude that the ECC-lipid model with ECC-ion parameters
gives a realistic binding affinity for the Na$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$ binding
in POPC bilayer.

Based on the ion density profiles along membrane normal
in Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl-dens}, the Ca$^{2+}$ binding seems to
be stronger in Lipid14 model with Dang and ECC-ions.
This is in agreement 
This is quantified by calculating the relative surface
excess from Eq.~\ref{surfexcess}. This gives 
$\Gamma_i^w = 0.07 nm^{-3}$ for ECC-lipid model simulated with ECC-ions,
which is significantly smaller than $\Gamma_i^w = XX nm^{-3}$ for
Lipid14 with \AA{}qvist and $\Gamma_i^w = 0.3 nm^{-3}$ with Dang ions.
\todo{Surface excess for Lipid14 with Aqvist yet to be added.} \\
\todo{Surface excess units are not correct. Maybe the numbers needs to be checked also?} \\
Rough estimates for the free energy difference between bound and unbound cation
can made from
\begin{equation}
  \Delta G={\rm k_b T}\log(\frac{p_o}{p_i}),
\end{equation}
where $p_o$ and $p_i$ are estimated from the Ca$^{2+}$densities in bulk water and
in the maximum density in bilayer, respectively. The density profiles in
Fig. \ref{fig:cacl-dens} give $\sim 0.8$ k$_{\rm b}$T for the free energy difference
between bound and unbound Ca$^{2+}$ ions in ECC-lipid model and $\sim 1.4$ k$_{\rm b}$T
in Lipid14 with \AA{}qvist.

  area per molecules measured at \cite{petrache06,pabst07,uhrikova08}

\end{figure}

Since ECC--lipid model gives a good agreement with experiments for the response
of headgroup order parameters to the bound charge as well as to the CaCl$_2$
concentration,

The good agreement with experiments indicates
that the ECC corrected lipid model has a sufficient accuracy for realistic
studies of details of ions binding to lipid bilayers.



\subsection{Binding stoichiometry}

  \caption{\label{fig:cacl-bind}
    Binding isotherm assuming stoichiometry of 2~POPC:1~\ce{Ca^{2+}} as used in \cite{altenbach84} fits our simulation data well .
    }
\end{figure}

The good agreement of ECC-lipids model with experiments encourages us to analyse the
molecular binding details from MD simulations. Direct analysis of contacts between ions and
lipids from simulations suggest that the most abundant POPC:\ce{Ca^2+} complex 
has stoichiometry of 2~POPC:1~\ce{Ca^{2+}}.
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl-bind} this is in agreement
with the ternary complex model suggested based on head group order parameter
experiments~\cite{altenbach84}.
In addition to the ternary complexes, there also is a non-negligable probability
of one \ce{Ca^{2+}} cross-bridging three POPC molecules.
Technical details of the analysis are in the SI. 

In addition, we estimated the relative binding affinities of several moieties in POPC:
phosphate moiety, side chain 1 carbonyl group and side chain 2 carbonyl group.
Using the probability isodensity contours (see Fig.~\ref{fig:volmaps}), 
we estimate that the largest contribution
to the binding of \ce{Ca2+} to POPC membranes likely comes from the phosphate group. 
Although the isodensity plots are relatively easy to interpret,
the contours shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:volmaps} cannot conclusively tell on the details
of \ce{Ca2+} binding to any of the two carbonyl moieties. 

\todo{JOE: Put details of the cation-binding stoichiometry analysis to SI.} \\
\todo{JOE: Update the binding isotherm figure with new simulations} \\
\todo{SAMULI: The same authors have also literature, where they say that ternary complex may not
  be the only option. I will recheck and come back to this.
  SAMULI: This is written in \cite{macdonald87}:
  ''Ca2+binding to POPC bilayers over the whole concentration range can be best described in terms
  of formation of a ternary complex involving complexation of two lipids to one calcium ion (Altenbach and Seelig, 1984).
  The addition of a sodium competition term has not changed this conclusion. However, if Ca2+ concentrations
  up to 100 mM are considered, the data can be equally well explained by a 1:1 binding mechanism (cf. Figure 7).
  In contrast, the Ca2+ binding to POPC-POPG mixtures can be best described by assuming a 1:l stoichiometry regardless of the range of Ca2+concentrations.''
  We might or might not want to discuss about this.} \\
\todo{SAMULI: I would also analyze how much there is contact between ions and different
parts of the lipid (phosphase, carbonyl, etc.).
JOE: Pavel suggest using volumetric map (e.g. in VMD) to visualise the amounts of Ca, Na and Cl bound to different moieties.} \\
\todo{SAMULI: I think we should quantify this, i.e. how much there are these.
  Maybe also the other possible complexes? Maybe also the correlation betweem complexes
  and binding sites, if it is not too much work.
  JOE: This looks like a careful work for the next paper to me. 
  I'd only add a relatively simple analysis of binding sites and probably the propensity of 1-2-3 membered clusters.
  SAMULI: I agree that we should not use too much time on this now.}. \\

\section{Conclusions}
We show that the \ce{Na^+} and \ce{Ca^2+} binding in phospholipid bilayers can
be accurately described with classical MD simulation models, where electronic
polarization is effectively included by using electronic continuum correction (ECC)~\cite{leontyev11}.
This is a significant improvement over other available lipid models,
which all overestimate specific cation binding affinities~\cite{catte16}.  
The newly proposed model, which we denote as ''ECC-lipids~17'', 
exhibits accurate head group order parameter response to
bound cations, monovalent \ce{Na^+} and cationic surfactant dihexadecyldimethylammonium bromide, 
and divalent \ce{Ca^2+}
also quantifying their binding affinities.
Moreover, ECC-lipids~17 reproduce the lipid bilayer structural details
with similar accuracy as other state of the art lipid models~\cite{catte16}.
Several water models 
(OPC3\cite{Izadi16}, OPC \cite{Izadi14}, SPC/E \cite{Berendsen1987} and TIP4p/2005 \cite{Abascal2005}) 
were used to exemplify the transferability of 
the parameters of the new ECC-lipids~17 force field. 

Direct analysis of calcium binding details from MD simulations is in agreement
with ternary complex model, which is suggested based on NMR data \cite{altenbach84}.
In this model 1~calcium binds to 2~POPC molecules, which together form a ternary
complex.
\todo{Continue summary using previous section once it is finished.}

The electronic continuum correction is applied here on Lipid14 POPC model \cite{dickson14},
but we expect that the correction can be generalized also for other lipids
and force fields.
The parameters can be used with existing standard nucleic acid and protein force fields, e.g. AMBER-FB15~\cite{Wang2017}. 
We suggest using state of the art water models like OPC3\cite{Izadi16} or OPC \cite{Izadi14},
which yield higher accuracy than the traditional TIP3p water model~\cite{jorgensen83}.
