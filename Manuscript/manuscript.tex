  Despite of the significant biological relevance, the binding details of cations in cellular
  lipid membranes are not fully understood. For example, consistent results for
  the binding affinities and stoichimetries of Na$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$ ions to phospholipid bilayers have not been
  achieved with different experimental and theoretical methods.
  The ion binding details could be resolved with classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations,
  however, the accuracy of the available lipid models has not been sufficient.
  In this work we show that the binding details of Na$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$ ions to
  1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayer
  can be accurately described with a MD simulation model having implicitly included electronic polarization.
  This is demonstrated by applying the electronic continuum correction (ECC) to a
  state of the art lipid model for MD simulations of POPC
  lipid bilayer. The introduced ECC-lipid model reproduces the experimentally measured structural parameters for the ion-free membrane,
  the response of lipid headgroup to the bound positive charge, and the binding affinities of
  Na$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$ ions. The imperceptible binding of Na$^+$ ions to POPC bilayer
  and interactions of Ca$^{2+}$ mainly with phoshpate oxygens in the ECC-lipid model give
  support to the early intepretations of the experimental spectroscopic data.
  On the other hand, Ca$^{2+}$ ions form complexes with 1-3 lipid molecules with almost
  equal probabilities, suggesting more complicated binding stoichimetry than 
  the ternary complex binding model used to interpret the NMR data.
  The results in this work pave the way for MD simulations of complex biochemical systems
  with realistic electrostatic interactions in the vicinity of cellular membranes.

\section{Introduction}
Cation interactions with cellular membranes play a key role in several biological processes,
such as signal propagation in neurons and vesicle fusion.
Since the direct measurements of ion-membrane interactions from biological systems
are difficult, lipid bilayers are often used as models systems for cellular
membranes. Especially the zwitterionic phosphocholine (PC) lipid bilayers are
used to understand the role of ions in complex biological
systems~\cite{scherer87,seelig90,cevc90}.

Interactions of biological cations, especially Na$^+$ and
Ca$^{2+}$, with PC bilayers are widely studied in
experiments~\cite{akutsu81,altenbach84,seelig90,cevc90,tocanne90,binder02,pabst07,uhrikova08}
and classical MD simulations~\cite{bockmann03,bockmann04,Berkowitz12,melcrova16,javanainen17}.
The details of ion binding are, however, not fully consistent in the literature.
%not agreed in the literature \cite{cevc90,tocanne90,seelig90,binder02,catte16,??}.
%General conclusion from experimental
%studies has been that multivalent ions and lithium have weak specific binding in
%phopholipid bilayers, while other monovalent ions do not essentially
%bind 
%The presence of anoinic lipids, like PS or PG,
%increase the concentration close to the bilayer and thus the amount of bound
%ions, but do not affect the specific binding constant \cite{seelig90}.
Interpretations of non-invansive spectroscopic methods, like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), scattering
and infrared spectroscopy suggest that Na$^+$ ions exhibit
negligible binding to PC lipid bilayers with submolar concentrations, while Ca$^{2+}$ specifically
binds to phosphate groups of two lipid molecules~\cite{hauser76,hauser78,herbette84,akutsu81,altenbach84,binder02,pabst07,uhrikova08}.
Atomistic resolution molecular dynamics (MD) simulation models, however, predict significantly
stronger binding for the cations than NMR experiments \cite{catte16}.
On the other hand, some experiments have also been interpreted to support the predictions from
MD simulations~\cite{bockmann03,vacha09a}. 
Furthermore, interactions of Calcium ions with 3-4 lipids,
including also interactions with carbonyl
oxygens, have been reported from simulations~\cite{bockmann03,bockmann04,melcrova16,javanainen17}.


Recent work published by the NMRlipids project (\url{nmrlipids.blogspot.fi})~\cite{catte16}
made an attempt to resolve the apparent controversies. A direct comparison of
ion binding affinities to PC bilayers was presented between simulations and
experiments by using the electrometer concept, which is based on the experimental NMR data
for the lipid headgroup order parameters~\cite{seelig87}.
Using massive amounts of data collected by Open Collaboration method, it was concluded
that the accuracy of the current state of the art lipid models for MD
simulations is not sufficient for the detailed interpretation of the cation
interactions with PC lipid bilayers~\cite{catte16}.

%\todo{PAVEL: introduce previous theoretical work that discusses cation binding to POPC w.r.t. its specific moiteties, e.g. Lukas' paper}.

%While relative binding affinity of different ions in PC lipids is agreed to follow Hoffmeister
%series, the molecular details of binding and binding energetics are

%The binding details, like binding sites and stoichiometry are not yet fully
%resolved but interpretation of NMR and scattering experiments suggest that one
%Ca2+ interacts mainly with the choline groups \cite{hauser76,hauser78,herbette84} of two
%phospholipid molecules \cite{altenbach84}.

In this work we show that the cation binding behavior
in MD simulations of 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayer can be significantly 
improved by implicitly including the electronic polarizability
in the polar region of lipid molecules. The electronic
polarizability is included by using the electronic
continuum correction (ECC)~\cite{leontyev11}, which
has been previously shown to improve the behaviour of
MD simulations of ions in bulk water~\cite{jungwirth17-new-paper-to-be-published,Pluharova2014,kohagen14,kohagen16}. 
As a starting point we use the parameters from the Lipid14 model \cite{dickson14},
which gave the best cation binding behaviour in the previous study \cite{catte16}.
The developed ECC-lipid parameters reproduce the experimentally
measurable structural parameters of an ion-free POPC lipid bilayer with the 
accuracy comparable to the other state of the art lipid models, while surpassing
them significantly for reproducing the membrane binding affinities and induced
structural effects of Sodium and Calcium ions.


%Since the cation binding affinity and the headgroup 
%order parameter changes are in good agreement with experiments
%in the proposed ECC-lipids, it can be used to interpret the
%related structural changes and ion binding stoichiometry.
%New lipid models with correct ion binding affinity in lipid
%bilayers are necessary in applications of 
%MD simulations with physiological salt conditions. 
%The overestimated cation binding in the current lipid models \cite{catte16}
%may lead to significant artefacts in MD simulations. For example,
%articifially positively charged membranes overestimate interactions
%with biomolecules having opposite sign.


\section{Methods}

\subsection{Electronic continuum correction for lipid bilayers}\label{section:ecc}
The lack of electronic polarizability in the standard MD simulation
force fields has been considered a higly relevant issue since the early days of
lipid bilayer simulations.
In this work we circumvent the rather demanding explicit inclusion
of electronic polarization effects \cite{lucas12,chowdhary13} by implicitly including
electronic polarizability in lipid
bilayer simulations by using the electronic continuum correction
(ECC)~\cite{leontyev11}. 
Technically, it is a similar approach to the phenomenological charge-scaling as applied in 
earlier studies \cite{jonsson86,egberts94}.
\todo{We should also cite papers where empirical scaling was used ionic liquids DOI: 10.1002/anie.201308760}
The present concept of ECC is, however, 
physically well justified and rigorously derived~\cite{leontyev09, leontyev10, leontyev11}.


Following the ECC concept, electronic
polarizability can be effectively included in classical MD simulations by
placing all particles into a homogeneous dielectric continuum 
with a dielectric constant $\epsilon _{el}$, 
which is the electronic part of the dielectric constant of 
the media \cite{leontyev11}. 
Following the Coulomb's law, such a dielectric continuum can be easily included in standard MD simulation by
a scaling of charges 
\begin{equation}
  Q^{ECC} = f_q \cdot Q
\end{equation}
with a constant scaling factor $f_q = \epsilon _{el} ^{-1/2}$ 
effectively representing the newly introduced electronic continuum. 
Given the  high frequency dielectric constant as measured in water (corresponding to the square of the refraction index) of  $\epsilon _{el} = 1.78$,  
the scaling factor for aqueous ions is $f_q = 0.75$ \cite{some_orig_source, leontyev11}. This scaling factor has been
successfully used to improve the performance of force field for ions in solution \cite{kohagen14,kohagen16,??},
which then agree quantitatively with neutron scattering data \cite{kohagen14,kohagen16, Pluharova2014}. 

While the scaling factor of $f_q = 0.75$ for ions in water improves their description and is physically well justified within the ECC theory \cite{Leontyev2011},
it is not a priori  clear whether the same factor should be used for partial charges in molecules,
e.g., lipids in our case. Unlike the total charge of an atom or molecules, atomic partial charges within molecules are not physical observables.
There are thus several schemes for the assignment of partial charges for biomolecules~\cite{Hu2007}.
Currently, the most commonly employed scheme is the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) method~\cite{RESP_paper,Singh1984}.
By construction, partial charges currently implemented in force fields may already 
include  to some extend the solvent electronic polarizability effects, i.e.,
the RESP charges are often scaled to fit certain experimental observables \todo{This needs a citation - Joe please pick 1-2 papers}. 
Thus, a consistent application of the ECC scaling factor, $f_q$, to the molecular partial charges
included in the available force fields does not necessarily have to follow the above relation $f_q = \epsilon _{el} ^{-1/2}$, 
but instead it lies between 0.75 i.e., (no electronic polarizability included in the original partial charges)
and $1$ (i.e., electronic polarizability fully included in the original partial charges).
It is important to note that even thought the lipid bilayer interface has a large gradient in
the total dielectric constant, the electronic polarizability part can be considered to be constant
as the measurements of high frequency dielectric constant gives values around 2 
for almost any biologically relevant material \cite{some_original_work, leontyev11}.


In this work, we employ the ECC to develop a classical MD simulation model for
a POPC lipid that accurately describes the binding of Sodium and Calcium ions to a lipid bilayer.
%This is a biologically highly relevant membrane feature, which is
%poorly reproduced by currently available models. This can affect not only on membrane properties
%in the presence of ions but also modulate interactions with charged moieties at the interface.
The model quality in terms of the ion binding is measured by directly
comparing simulations to the experimental NMR data used to measure the ion binding
affinity~\cite{akutsu81,altenbach84,scherer89}, as discussed in detail in Ref. \citenum{catte16}.
The Lipid14~\cite{dickson14} force field parameters (available in Gromacs format from Ref. \citenum{lipid14files})
were used as a starting point, because they give the most
realistic response to the bound ions and to the NaCl concentration 
among the available lipid models (see Figs.~5~and~2 in Ref.~\citenum{catte16}).
Moreover, the Lipid14 model gave relatively realistic glycerol backbone and
head group structures when compared with the other state of the art lipid models~\cite{botan15}.

The ECC correction was applied to the Lipid14 parameters by scaling partial charges of the head group,
glycerol backbone, and carbonyl regions, which are the most polar parts in the  lipids and
are thus expected to have the largest contribution to the cation binding.
We do not modify the hydrocarbon chain parameters, as they
do not come in direct contact with salt ions and are
already highly optimized to provide a good description for the
hydrophobic part of lipid bilayers \cite{dickson14,ollila16}.
This is in contrasts with the glycerol backbone and the head group regions, 
which call for improvements in all available lipid models~\cite{botan15}.

The values within the above discussed parameter space for the scaling factor, $f_q~\in~(0.75, 1.0)$,
were explored to find the optimal value to reproduce the experimental ion binding affinity.
We observed that the scaling
of the partial charges reduced the ion binding affinity and the 
related head group order parameter response in general.
By comparing the results with different scaling factors to the experimental 
NMR data~\cite{akutsu81,altenbach84,scherer89} we found the optimal 
value of $f_q = 0.8$,
which is only slighly higher than the scaling factor for the ions in water 0.75.
%, which implies
%that electronic polarization effects are only to a small extent effectively accounted for in the Lipid14 force field. 

While, the scaling of the partial charges improved the ion binding affinity,
it reduced the bilayer area per lipid below the experimental value. 
%Simulations with Lipid14 parameters having 
After scaling the partial charges of the head group, the glycerol
backbone and carbonyls with a factor of 0.8, the simulation gave 
the approximately 60~\AA$^2$ for the area per lipid,
which is somewhat smaller than the experimental value, 64.3~\AA$^2$ \cite{kucerka11}, 
as well as the value given by the original Lipid14 parameters, $65.6 \pm 0.5$~\AA$^2$~\cite{dickson14}.
The decrease of the area per lipid is found to arise from a reduced hydration of the lipid head group region,
due to the lower polarity of molecules with scaled charges. This can be compensated
by reducing the effective radius of atoms with the scaled charges by changing 
the $\sigma$ parameters in the Lennard-Jones potential, 
as previously done for ions in solution \cite{kohagen14,kohagen16,Pluharova2014}.
After reducing these $\sigma$ parameters by a factor of $f_\sigma = 0.89$, the area per molecule is restored
back close to the experimental value (see Table~\ref{tab:apls}). 

\todo{We should discuss how this can potentially affect the intermolecular interaction when mixing scaled and non scaled molecules. \\
  JOE: I think that we rather increasingly see that there's nothing like ``fully non-scaled'' with the exception of ions with integer
  charges. So the discussion shall be rather more about the interaction of our ``scaled'' (I'd still rather call it ECC-corrected or whatever)
  and ``semi-scaled'' models. \\
SAMULI: There is now a paragraph in the conclusions, which mentions this topic.}



\subsection{Electrometer concept} \label{section:electrometer}
Ion binding in lipid bilayers was compared between experiments and simulations by 
using the lipid head group order parameters and the
''electrometer concept'' \cite{seelig87,catte16}, which
is based on the experimental observation that the C-H bond
order parameters of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbons in PC lipid head group
(see Fig.~\ref{simVSexpNOions}) are proportional to the amount 
of charge bound per lipid~\cite{seelig87}.
The change of order parameters measured with varying aqueous
ion concentration can be then related to the amount of bound ions.

The concept can be used to compare the ion binding affinity to lipid 
bilayers between MD simulations and  NMR experiments, because the order
parameters can be accurately determined from both techniques~\cite{catte16,ollila16}.
The order parameters for all C-H bonds in lipid molecules, including
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ segments in head group, can be accurately measured
using $^2$H NMR or $^{13}$C NMR techniques \cite{ollila16}. From MD simulations the
order parameters can be calculated using the definition
\begin{equation}\label{OP}
S_{\rm CH}=\frac{3}{2}\langle \cos^2\theta -1 \rangle,
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the angle between the bond and membrane
normal and the average is taken over all sampled configurations \cite{ollila16}.

The relation between the amount of the bound charge per lipid,  $X^\pm$, and
the head group order parameter change, $\Delta S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}$,
is empirically quantified as~\cite{seelig87,ferreira16}
\begin{equation}\label{OPchangeEQ}
  \Delta S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}= S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}(X^\pm)-S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}(0) \approx \frac{4m_i }{3\chi}X^\pm,
\end{equation}
where $S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}(0)$ denote the order parameter in the absence of bound charge,
$i$ refers to either $\alpha$ or $\beta$ carbon,
$m_i$ is an empirical constant depending on the valency and position of the bound charge,
and the experimental value \cite{seelig77,davis83}, $\chi \approx$\,167\,kHz, is used for the quadrupole coupling constant.
Atomic absorption spectra and $^2$H NMR data gave
$m_\alpha=-20.5$~kHz  and $m_\beta=-10.0$~kHz for the binding of
Ca$^{2+}$ to POPC bilayer (in the presence of 100~mM NaCl)~\cite{altenbach84,ollila16,catte16}.
The slopes are negative, because the head group order parameters
decrease with bound positive charge and increase with bound negative
charge~\cite{ollila16,catte16}. This can be rationalized as a change
of the lipid head group dipole tilt toward water phase with the bound positive
charge and {\it vice versa} with the negative charge~\cite{seelig87}. 

The measured order parameter change depends on both, the head group response 
to the bound charge and the amount of bound charge, i.e. $m_i$ and $X^\pm$
in Eq.~\ref{OPchangeEQ}, respectively. The former property has to be
well quantified before the electrometer concept can used to 
analyze the binding affinities, as done experimentally for a wide range
of systems~\cite{seelig87,beschiasvili91}. To calibrate 
the head group order parameter response to the bound charge in simulations,
we use the experimental data for dihexadecyldimethylammoniumbromide %(2C$_{16}$$^+$N2C$_1$Br$^-$)
mixed within a POPC bilayer~\cite{scherer89}. Dihexadecyldimethylammonium\\[0.5cm]

is a cation surfactant having two acyl chains and bearing a unit
charge in the hydrophilic end. Thus, it is expected to locate
in the bilayer similarly to the phospholipids and the molar ratio then 
gives directly the amount of bound unit charge per lipid $X^\pm$ in these systems~\cite{scherer89}.

\subsection{Salt concentrations and binding affinity}
The early electrometer concept data for the lipid head group
order parameter changes from the NMR experiments was reported as a function 
of the salt concentration in water before solvating
the lipids~\cite{akutsu81}. The later study used also the atomic absorption
spectroscopy and reported the order parameter changes as
a function of the salt concentration in the supernatant after the
solvation of lipids~\cite{altenbach84}.
In this work we focus on POPC for which the latter definition was used~\cite{altenbach84}.
The salt concentration in the aqueous bulk region was calculated from 
the farthest point from both lipid leaflets in the water phase. 
Note that in the previous study, Ref.~\citenum{catte16},
the ion concentrations were calculated in water before solvating the lipids 
as in the earlier experiments~\cite{akutsu81}.
Despite of the measurable differences between these two
definitions of concentrations for CaCl$_2$ systems,
the qualitative conclusions in this or in the previous work~\cite{catte16} are
not affected by this. 

To quantify the ion binding affinity to a lipid bilayer, we
calculated the relative surface excess of ions with respect to water,~$\Gamma_i^w$~\cite{chattorajBOOK}.
This quantity was chosen because it does not depend on
%the definition of the interfacial region or
the position of the Gibbs dividing plane between two bulk regions.
%\todo{JOE: following is very unclear to me. I think we can write it in a more concise way.}
%SAMULI: Here is a new trial.
Here we assume that the interface locates between the hydrophobic interior
of a lipid bilayer and the bulk water region far from the membrane.
The bulk concentration of ions and water is zero inside the bilayer.
The concentrations in bulk water region can be calculated from 
the farthest point from both lipid leaflets in the water phase.
The region between these boundaries contains all the ions and water
molecules in the simulation box.
%our whole simulation box as
%an interface flanked by a water phase and an ideal phase with the characteristics of to
%the hydrophobic region in the middle of the membrane where no ions or waters are present.
This setup provides a simplified relation for $\Gamma_i^w$ in lipid bilayers simulations 
\begin{equation}\label{surfexcess}
  \Gamma_i^w=\frac{1}{2A_b} \left ( n_i - n_w \frac{C_i}{C_w} \right ) ,
\end{equation}
where $n_w$ and $n_i$ are the total number of waters and ions in the system;
$C_w$ and $C_i$ are their respective bulk concentrations in the aqueous phase;
and $A_b$ is the area of the box in the membrane plane.
The total area of the interface is twice the area of the membrane, $2A_b$,
because bilayers have an interface at both leaflets.



\subsection{Validation of lipid bilayer structure against experiments}

The structure of lipid bilayers in simulations without ions were validated against NMR and 
\mbox{x-ray} scattering experiments by calculating the order parameters
for C-H bonds and the scattering form factors. The former validates the structures sampled by the individual
lipid molecules in simulations with atomic resolution, while the latter
validates the dimensions of the lipid bilayer (thickness and area per
molecule)~\cite{ollila16}.

The order parameters were calculated from simulations for all C-H bonds
in lipid molecules by using Eq. \ref{OP}. Form factors were calculated 
from equation \todo{As Hector suggested, it might be better to write the simpler
form for this equation.}
\begin{equation}
  F(q) = \int _{-D/2} ^{D/2} \left ( \sum _\alpha f_\alpha (q_z) n_\alpha (z) - \rho _s \right ) \exp (izq_z) \mathrm{d}z,
\end{equation}
where $f_\alpha(q_z)$ is the density of atomic scattering length, 
$\rho_s$ is the density of solvent scattering length in the bulk region,
$n_\alpha (z)$ is the number density of atom $\alpha$ and
$z$ is the distance from the membrane centre along its normal 
spanning until the water bulk region, $D$. 




\subsection{Simulation details}

\subsubsection{Simulations of POPC bilayers with aqueous ions}
Simulations of POPC bilayer in pure water or in varying salt concentrations
contained 128 POPC molecules and approximately 50~SPC/E~water~\cite{Berendsen1987} molecules per each lipid
in the periodic orthorhombic simulation box. The chosen water model 
has the optimal dielectric constant
to be used with the ECC modified molecules \todo{Citation or discussion.} and it has been

%which is currently the most accurate three site rigid water model

Simulation with the Lipid14 model was also ran with the ion model by
Dang et al.~\cite{smith94,chang1999,dang2006}\todo{Which water model was used in this simulation?}.
Simulation data for the Lipid14 model with \AA{}qvist~\cite{aqvist90} ion and TIP3P~\cite{jorgensen83}

\subsubsection{Simulations of POPC bilayers with cationic surfactants}
An automated topology builder \cite{malde11} was first used to create the structure of
dihexadecyldimethylammonium.
The AmberTools program \cite{amber} was then used to generate the Amber-type force field
parameters. The parameters were converted to the Gromacs format by using
the acpype tool \cite{acpype}. The partial charges were then manually modified
to approximately correspond to their equivalent segments in Lipid14 \cite{dickson14}.
The parameters together with the simulation data are available
at~\cite{POPClipid14T313K,POPClipid1410perCATsurfT313K,POPClipid1420perCATsurfT313K,POPClipid1430perCATsurfT313K,POPClipid1442perCATsurfT313K,POPClipid1450perCATsurfT313K}.
The surfactants were randomly placed among the lipids to form bilayer structures with
mole fractions of 10\%, 20\%, 30\%, 42\%, or 50\% of surfactant in the POPC bilayer.
All systems contained 50 POPC molecules per leaflet, 6340 TIP3P~\cite{jorgensen83} water molecules and
6, 14, 21, 35, or 50 surfactants per leaflet. 
Chloride counter ions were used

The ECC-lipid and Lipid14 models reproduce the experimental x-ray scattering form factors
of POPC bilayer with the similar accuracy in Fig.~\ref{simVSexpNOions}.
The area per lipid values from the Lipid14 model is slightly larger than the
experimental value in Table~\ref{tab:apls}, while the value from ECC-lipid model
is slightly smaller. Area per lipid values of the ECC-lipid model show some variation
when simulated with different water models in Table~\ref{tab:apls_si} (Supplementary Information),
however, all the values are close to the experimentally reported values.
In conclusion, the ECC-lipid model reproduces the experimental dimensions of POPC
lipid bilayer with the accuracy comparable to the other state of the art lipid models \cite{ollila16}.
%The optimal value for $f_\sigma$ was found by representing the overall membrane structure well
%by matching scattering form factors to experimental data~\cite{Petrache06, Kucerka08, Pabst10}.

The acyl chain order parameters of the Lipid14 model~\cite{dickson14} and the
ECC-lipid model agree with the experimental values with in the error bars
in Fig.~\ref{simVSexpNOions}, althought the ECC-lipid model gives slightly larger
values for {\it sn}-1 chain. Notably, the experimentally measured forking and
small order parameter values of $C_2$ segment in {\it sn}-2 chain are relatively well
reproduced by the both models. This has been suggested to indicate that the carbonyl
of {\it sn}-2 chain is directed towards the water phase, in contrast to the
carbonyl in {\it sn}-1 chain, which would orient more along the bilayer
plane~\cite{seelig75,schindler75,gawrisch92}. While this may be an important
feature for the ion binding details, it is not necessarily reproduced by the
available lipid models~\cite{ollila16}
%This is expected as the ECC model does not modify
%the already highly optimized parameters of this region in Lipid14. 

The order parameters of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbons in the headgroup are slightly larger
in the ECC-lipid model than in the Lipid14 model, which is apparently related to the
P-N vector orienting 7$^{\circ}$ more toward the water phase in the ECC-lipid model, 
see Fig.~\ref{OrderParameterCHANGESsurf}. With the current data we cannot,
however, conclude which one of the models give the more realistic
headgroup conformations. The ECC-lipid model gives
the $\beta$ carbon order parameter value closer to experiments, while
value for $\alpha$ carbon is better in the Lipid14 model.
Despite of some deviations from the experimental order parameter values
in Fig. \ref{simVSexpNOions},
the accuracy of the both models in the glycerol backbone region
is comparable to the other state
of art lipid models available in literature \cite{botan15}.

\end{figure}

Before proceeding to the ion binding affinity, we quantify
the response of the headgroup order parameters to the amount of 
bound charge by using mixtures of monovalent cationic
surfactants (dihexadecyldimethylammonium)
and POPC~\cite{scherer89}. The amount of bound charge per PC 
in these systems is given by the molar fraction of cationic 
surfactants, because essentially all surfactants with two hydrophopic
acyl chains can be assumed to locate in the lipid bilayers.
The experimental data for these systems can be used to validate 
the sensitivity of lipid headgroup order parameters
to the amount of bound charge in simulations.

The changes of the headgroup order parameters with an increasing amount of 
the cationic surfactant is compared between experiments~\cite{scherer89} and
simulations in Fig. \ref{OrderParameterCHANGESsurf}.
Approximately linear decrease of the order parameters, as expected from Eq. \ref{OPchangeEQ},
is observed in simulations and experiments at least for the mole fractions
below $\sim$30\%. The slope is, however, too steep in the Lipid14 model indicating that 
the head group order parameters respond too sensitively to the bound positive charge.
The slope in the ECC-lipid model is in very good agreement with experiments
for the $\alpha$ segment, while the slope is slightly
underestimated for the $\beta$ segment.

The headgroup P-N vector angle with respect to the membrane normal
is also shown in Fig.~\ref{OrderParameterCHANGESsurf}
as a function of the mole fraction of the cationic surfactant.
As suggested previously~\cite{seelig87}, the headgroup orients
more towards the water phase with the increasing amount of positive
charge in a PC lipid bilayer. The effect is more pronounced in the
Lipid14 model, for which the addition of 50\% mole fraction of the cationic
surfactant leads to the decrease of 20$^{\circ}$ of the P-N vector angle,
while the corresponding change in the ECC-lipid model is 11$^{\circ}$.
The difference is in line with the smaller order parameter 
changes and the reduced charge--dipole interactions in the latter model.
The lesser sensitivity of the P-N vector angle response in the ECC-lipid
model can be considered to be more realistic, because the changes of the headgroup
order parameters as a function of the bound positive charge
are in better agreement with experiments in this model.
The results also imply that the validation and improvements of MD simulation
models are generally required for the reliable simulation studies of the
lipid headgroup responses to ions or other biomolecules, as also concluded
previously \cite{botan15}.


%
%Therefore we use the data in Fig.~\ref{OrderParameterCHANGESsurf}
%to suggest a linear relation between $\alpha$-carbon order parameter
%and average P-N vector angle changes $\Delta \Theta_{\rm P-N}=?? \Delta S_{\rm CH}^{\alpha}$.
%This can be used to estimate the change in P-N vector angle
%from experiments measuring changes in $\alpha$-carbon order parameter. 
%\todo{SAMULI: I think that we should establish the relation between 
%order parameter and P-N vector angle changes by using ECC-lipids model.
%This would be useful for people measuring aplha order parameter
%changes from experiments.}
%
%For example, $\Delta S_{\rm CH}^{\alpha}=0.018$ measured due to the
%addition of 66.8 $\mu$M concentration of Mellittin in bulk water \cite{kuchinka89}
%gives $\Delta \Theta_{\rm P-N} = 2.5^{\circ}$.

%the actual relation if we decide to put this.}

The changes of the lipid bilayer headgroup order parameter from different simulations and
experiments \cite{akutsu81,altenbach84} are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl} and~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_NaCl}
as a function of NaCl and CaCl$_2$ concentrations.
%Responses to NaCl concentrations are in SI, Fig.~S\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_NaCl}.
These results can be used to compare the ion binding affinities to lipid bilayers
between simulations and experiments by using the electrometer concept, because 
the order parameters decrease proportionally to the amount of bound positive charge~\cite{seelig87,catte16}. 
The recent comparison of different simulation models to the experimental data
revealed that most models significantly overestimate the Na$^+$ ion binding to PC
lipid bilayers and that none of the available models correctly reproduce
the details of the binding of Ca$^{2+}$ ions \cite{catte16}.
A positive exception was the Lipid14 model \cite{dickson14} simulated with \AA{}qvist ions,
as seen from the data replotted from Ref.~\citenum{catte16} in Figs.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl} and~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_NaCl}.
The model reproduced the experimentally measured small order parameter changes with NaCl
and imperceptible Na$^+$ binding to PC bilayers \cite{akutsu81,altenbach84}.
However, the changes of the headgroup order parameters as a function of CaCl$_2$ 
concentration were overestimated by the same combination of force field parameters.

Since significant artefacts are reported in simulations with \AA{}qvist ions is water \cite{??} \todo{Add citations},
we also simulated the Lipid14 model with the ion models by Dang et al.~\cite{smith94,chang1999,dang2006} and
ECC-ions~\cite{jungwirth17-new-paper-to-be-published, kohagen16, Pluharova2014} having
more realistic bulk behaviour. Instead of the improvement in the binding behaviour,
we observed overbinding also of Na$^+$ with these ions models, while the results
with Ca$^{2+}$ were barely affected,
%for the CaCl$_2$ interactions with a POPC bilayer described by the Lipid14 model,
as seen in Figs. \ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl} and S??.%\ref{fig:ordPars_waterModels} (in SI), respectively.
\todo{Add OP-response of Lipid14+ECC-ions plot in SI}.
The results are in line with the previous work \cite{catte16},
suggesting that the improvements in the lipid parameters are
required to correctly describe the divalent cation binding to PC lipid bilayers.

%To improve the cation binding behaviour to POPC lipid bilayer we implicitly included the electronic
%polarization to the Lipid14 model by using the ECC approach as described in section \ref{section:ecc}.
The results from the simulations with the ECC-lipid and the ECC-ion models \cite{jungwirth17-new-paper-to-be-published, kohagen16, Pluharova2014}
exhibit an improved behaviour of cation binding to a POPC bilayer in Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl},
showing a good agreement with experiments in the changes of 
the lipid headgroup order parameters as a function of NaCl and CaCl$_2$ concentrations.
Since also the headgroup order parameter
response the to the bound positive charge the ECC-lipid model
was in good agreement with experiments in section \ref{section:boundCHARGE},
we conclude that the model correctly reproduces the binding affinity of
Na$^{+}$ and Ca$^{2+}$ ions to POPC lipid bilayer.
Also the response of the glycerol backbone $g_3$ order parameter to CaCl$_2$ was
signifincantly overestimated in the original Lipid14 model, while the ECC-lipid
gives a good agreement with exepriments, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl}.
Also the changes of the P-N vector angle are more prononced
for the Lipid14 model, for which the maximum CaCl$_2$ induced tilting 
toward water phase is approximately 17$^{\circ}$, while the corresponding
value for ECC-lipid model is 6$^{\circ}$.

Furthermore, the overestimated lipid headgroup order parameter changes of POPC in the Lipid14
model as a function of CaCl$_2$ concentration arise from both, the overestimated
binding affinity and sensitivity of the headgroup tilt to the bound positive charge.
This probably applies also to the other lipid models considered in the previous study~\cite{catte16},
emphasizing the importance of the comparison of the lipid headgroup order parameter response
to the bound charge between simulations and experiments as done in section \ref{section:boundCHARGE}.

The ion binding affinity of ECC-lipid model with different water models is compared
in SI. The performance with all water models is better than in in the original Lipid14
parameteres, but the order parameter changes are slightly overestimated
with all four-site water models and with TIP3P.

  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The binding affinities of Ca$^{2+}$ ions to POPC bilayer in different simulation 
models were quantified by calculating the relative surface excess from Eq.~\ref{surfexcess} 
using the bulk concentrations determined from the density profiles in Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl-dens}. 
The relative surface excess values, shown in Table~\ref{tab:binding},
were calculated from simulations with the same, $350\,\mathrm{mM}$, concentration of CaCl$_2$ with 
respect to water, i.e., the concentration before solvating the lipids in experiments.
As expected from the changes of the lipid headgroup order parameters in Fig. \ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl}, 
the relative surface excess for the ECC-lipid model, $\Gamma_{\rm Ca}^w = 0.07 \pm 0.01 \rm{nm}^{-2}$,
is significantly smaller than for the Lipid14 model with \AA{}qvist ions, $\Gamma_{\rm Ca}^w = 0.13 \pm 0.01 \rm{nm}^{-2}$,
or with Dang ions, $\Gamma_{\rm Ca}^w = 0.3 \pm 0.03 \rm{nm}^{-2}$.
\todo{JOE: I'd put the $\Gamma$ values into a table SAMULI: They are now in the table \ref{tab:binding} 
together with probabilities of the calcium binding probabilities to different POPC oxygens.

Interestingly, the relative surface excess of 
\ce{NaCl} at $1\,\mathrm{M}$ concentration (ECC-ions~\cite{Pluharova2014}) 
calculated using density profiles in Fig.~\ref{fig:nacl-dens}
is qualitatively different from \ce{CaCl2}
having a negative value $\Gamma_i^w = -0.1 \pm 0.01 \rm{nm}^{-2}$, 
meaning that water molecules are preferred to sodium and chloride ions at the membrane-water interface. 
This is in contrast to the most of the available lipid force fields,
which predict a specific binding of sodium on 
PC lipid bilayers \cite{catte16}.

%SAMULI: I commented out the average number of contacts. All the essential information

%this value is merely
%$\Sigma ^\mathrm{Ca^{2+}} _\mathrm{O_{carb.}} = 0.066 $.    % = 8.4/128 . 
The results in Table \ref{tab:binding} show that almost all (99\%) of the 
bound Ca$^{2+}$ ions are in contact with the phosphate oxygens and a quarter
of them (25\%) interacts with the carbonyl oxygens. Thus, the interactions between
Calcium ions with only carbonyl oxygens are very unlikely (1\%), but significant
amount of the ions interact with both, phosphate and carbonyl oxygens.
The individual lipids or acyl chains were not identified in the analysis,
thus the simultaneous ion contacts with both oxygen moieties may be inter or intra molecular
and occur with the carbonyls in the either of the acyl chains.
The most likely contacts between Ca$^{2+}$ ions and phosphate oxygens is visualized with
the probability isodensity contours in Fig.~\ref{fig:volmaps}.
While the higher concentrations of \ce{CaCl2} naturally increased the amount of contacts per lipid,
%for $850\,\mathrm{mM}$ concentration of \ce{CaCl2}

%it is even lower, 
%$\Sigma ^\mathrm{Na^{+}} _\mathrm{O_{carb.}} = 0.048 $.    % = 4.3/128 . 
The results show that \ce{Na+} ions bind only to the phosphate oxygens 
of POPC with the probablity of 55\% and only to the carbonyl oxygens with the
probability of 20\%, leaving the probability of 25\% for the
simultaneous binding to both.%, phosphate and carbonyl oxygens.  
%This is in line with the calculated negative value of 
%relative surface excess of sodium with respect to water, $\Gamma_i^w$, and
%their density profiles along the membrane normal (Fig.~\ref{fig:nacl-dens})
%suggesting that the populations of bound sodium cations 
%naturally decrease with the decreasing density of water. 

In conclusion, the results suggest that the Calcium ions specifically bind to phosphate
oxygens, while occasionally interacting also with carbonyls. This is in good agreement
with the previous conclusions from several experimental and theoretical
studies~\cite{hauser76,hauser78,herbette84,cevc90,binder02}, but
suggests lower relative binding affinity to carbonyls than the previous MD simulation
studies~\cite{bockmann03,bockmann04,melcrova16,javanainen17}.
Also the Sodium ions bind most likely to the phosphate oxygens, while the probability
of binding purely to carbonyls is also significant, in contrast to Calcium ions.
The physiological relevance of the Sodium binding details is, however, uncertain
due to the very weak binding affinity.

\subsection{Binding stoichiometry to POPC membrane}

%Binding probability:
%\ce{Ca2+} complex with \\
%1 POPC - 13\% -- 30\% \\
%2 POPC - 18\% -- 42\% \\
%3 POPC - 12\% -- 28\% \\

Simple binding models have been previous used to interpreted 
the same experimental data, which is used in this work to validate
the simulation models in Fig. \ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl}~\cite{altenbach84,macdonald87}.
The experimental results from the lipid headgroup order parameters and from the
atomic absorption spectroscopy were best
explained by the ternary complex binding model with a binding
stoichiometry of one \ce{Ca^{2+}} per two POPC lipids~\cite{altenbach84}.
However, also a Langmuir adsorption model (i.e. \ce{Ca^{2+}}:POPC stoichiometry of 1:1) 
was successfully fit to the experimental data when only low concentrations of \ce{CaCl2} were considered~\cite{macdonald87}.
The results based on these binding models and the measured headgroup order parameter changes
are also inluded in the tabulated experimental binding constants~\cite{marsh13}.

Since the same experimental data is reproduced by the ECC-lipid model,
it can be used to give a more versatile interepration of the binding stoichiometry than
the previously used simple binding models~\cite{altenbach84,macdonald87}. To directly evaluate the
stoichiometry from simulations we calculated the relative propensities of \ce{Ca^{2+}}:POPC
complexes with various stoichiometries by counting the individual lipid
molecules within the distance of $0.3\,\mathrm{nm}$ from each \ce{Ca^{2+}} ion.
The results from POPC simulation with 285~mM concetration of CaCl$_2$ in
Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl_complexes} show the largest propensity (42\%) for the
ternary complex with the \ce{Ca^{2+}}:POPC stoichiometry of 1:2, but 
the probabilities for the complexes with the stoichimetries of 1:1~(30\%)~and
1:3~(28\%)~are only slightly lower,
suggesting more complex binding stoichiometry than the simple ternary complex model.
%The observed propensities of
%$42\%$ for two lipids,
%$30\%$ for one lipid, and
%$28\%$ for three lipids 
However, one Calcium binds roughly to two lipids on average also in simulations,
because the probabilities of forming the complexes with 1 or 3 lipids are almost equal.  
This probably explains the successfull fit of the ternary complex model to the
experimental data. 
Complexes with more than three lipids per one Calcium ion were not observed in 
simulations with the ECC-lipids model.
\todo{I think that we either have to do the analysis in SI properly,
  i.e., using the real $C_I$ from simulations or remove the sentence below and
the related concent from SI.}
Ternary complex model also provides a good fit 
to our simulations with ECC-lipids 
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl-bind} in SI and its caption for details).

\subsection{Residence times of \ce{Na+} and \ce{Ca^{2+}} cations in POPC membrane}

Equilibration of \ce{Ca^{2+}} binding to POPC bilayer takes hundreds of
nanoseconds in MD simulations with CHARMM36 and Slipids force fields~\cite{javanainen17}, suggesting that
simulations with the length of several microseconds would be required
to study the binding phenomena in equilibrium. However, the density profiles of \ce{Ca^{2+}}
from the ECC-lipid simulation in Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl-dens} show a relatively shallow
minimum at the interface, suggesting a smaller barrier for the exchange of Calcium ions.
To quantify the ion binding exchange in lipid bilayer simulations, we calculated 
the residence times of ions within the distance of 0.3~nm from any oxygen atom
belonging to a lipid molecule in a bilayer.

The residence time histograms of \ce{Ca^{2+}}
in POPC bilayer are shown in Fig.~S\ref{fig:hist_residence_times} in SI 
from the ECC-lipid simulation with CaCl$_2$ concentration of 1~M
and from the CHARMM36 simulation with 450~mM concentration of
ECC-ions taken from the previous study \cite{javanainen17}
(the simulation data was downloaded from Ref.~\citenum{zenodo.259376}).
\todo{JOE: Plot a histogram of residence times based on our simulations and simulation from \citenum{javanainen17} and put it into SI.
}
\todo{It might be also better to do the analysis from ECC-lipid simulation with concentration closer
to the data in literature, i.e. 450mM.}
%Based on Fig. S17 in that work, Ref.~\citenum{javanainen17},
%we took the simulation with the apparent highest fluctuations of the number of bound calcium,
%which can be obtained at \url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.259376}
%and anaylsed the residence times.
% simulation: (Matti C36 with CaClMK, 800ns total):
Approximately 20\% of the \ce{Ca^{2+}} residence times in the CHARMM36 simulation are longer than
the lenght of the trajectory ($800\,\mathrm{ns}$),
and only less than 60\% of the bound residence times are shorter than the half
of the simulation length~(400~ns).
Even longer residence times are observed
in the other simulations with CHARMM36 and Slipids models reported in the previous work~\cite{javanainen17}.
At least order of magnitude faster exchange is observed in the
ECC-lipid model, where 90\% of the \ce{Ca^{2+}} residence times to a POPC membrane are 
shorter than $60\,\mathrm{ns}$, % exactly $53\,\mathrm{ns}$
and the longest observed residence time in the ECC-lipid simulation is $120\,\mathrm{ns}$, 
which is well below the total length of the simulation (200~ns).
The exchange of \ce{Na+} ions to a POPC membrane is
an order of magnitude faster, giving 90\%
of the residence times smaller than~$2\,\mathrm{ns}$,
the longest residence time being~$13\,\mathrm{ns}$. 
All the results are in line with the experimental estimation that 
the residence time of \ce{Ca^{2+}} at the individual PC headgroup 
is shorter than $10\,\mu\mathrm{s}$~\cite{altenbach84}.


%give a roughly estimate of the order
%of $1\,\mu\mathrm{s}$
%This is unfortunately not the case of many theoretical works,
%where the residence time cannot be estimated,
%or the simulation has not even decorrelated from it's 
%initial condition with a population of bound/unbound cations \cite{catte16}, 
%because it is limited by the simulation length, 
%even though it can be very long (order of $\mu\mathrm{s}$) in some works, e.g. reference~\citenum{javanainen17}. 
%Increasing time scales to the order of $\mu\mathrm{s}$ 
%doesn't help to alleviate such a problem in current lipid models \cite{javanainen17}. %and also \cite{catte16}, but same simulation was used. 

In conclusion, the results from ECC-lipid model suggest that the
exchange of bound Calcium occurs within $\sim$100ns timeframe,
which is much faster than previously reported~\cite{javanainen17}.
The sodium exhibit even faster exchange.
This suggests that simulations with the length of few hundred
nanoseconds are sufficient to simulate equilibrium ion binding
to PC lipid bilayers, when realistic force fields are used.
This has not been the case with the available lipid force fields,
which overestimate the binding streght of the cations \cite{javanainen17,catte16}.
%Such a finding changes the point of view on binding of calcium to PC membranes from
%a very strong long-term stable binding with rare exchanges to 
%a relatively frequent exchange of clacium cations 
%in equilibrium between membrane and solvent. 


\subsubsection{Internal side-note: }
However, $\Sigma ^\mathrm{Ca^{2+}} _\mathrm{O_{carb.}}$ is increased 
in simulation withy the highest \ce{CaCl2} concentration
when carbonyl dipoles are scaled only with 0.945 
(roughly done through charge redistribution)
 to : $\Sigma ^\mathrm{Ca^{2+}} _\mathrm{O_{carb.}} \approx 0.08 $.    % = (70.-59.8)/128 . 

The average number of contacts per lipid between \ce{Ca^{2+}} and any oxygen atom in POPC is 
$\Sigma ^\mathrm{Ca^{2+}} _\mathrm{O} = 0.264 \rightarrow 0.309 $,
whereas if only phosphate oxygen atoms are considered 
the average number of contacts decreases only by a tiny amount to 
$\Sigma ^\mathrm{Ca^{2+}} _\mathrm{PO_4} = 0.262 \rightarrow 0.303 $,    % = 33.5/128 . 
and if only carbonyl oxygen atoms are considered 
(phosphate oxygens contribute, but are not counted as contacts),
this value is merely
$\Sigma ^\mathrm{Ca^{2+}} _\mathrm{O_{carb.}} = 0.066 \rightarrow 0.139 $.    % = 8.4/128 . 

This means that calcium is in contact with a phosphate oxygen for 98\% of the time it is bound to the membrane, 
whereas 46\% of the time accounts for contact with a carbonyl oxygen,
and purely carbonyl bound states account for less than 2\% of configurations. 
The states that have a contribution from carbonyl oxygens also contain a bound phosphate, 
so it can be thought of rather as a stabilizing moiety. 

The residence times change to 75ns (90\% of bound time) and max is 185ns.
That's not much, too. It certainly is not a game changer, I'd even call it to be within accuracy. 
The slight problem may be that with this tweak, there's approx. 17\%  more cations bound to the membrane,
which means, I'd need to tune the sigma parameter a bit (increase the scaling factor $f_\sigma$). 
That could detune the membrane structure \dots
Not $f_q$ -- that's set by the simulations with the surfactant. Good.
I think that such a binding detail is within the accuracy of the proposed simple correction.
It would be worth noting that the model may underestimate slightly the contribution from carbonyls due to this. 
But we can't say to what extent\dots

\section{Conclusions}

By using the electrometer concept we show that the binding of \ce{Na^+} and \ce{Ca^2+} ions
to a POPC lipid bilayer can be accurately described with the classical MD simulation 
force field, where the electronic polarization is implicitly included using 
the electronic continuum correction (ECC)~\cite{leontyev11}.
The proposed ECC-lipids model is a significant improvement over 
other available lipid models, which all overestimate specific cation binding affinities~\cite{catte16}.  
While the structural details of a POPC lipid bilayer simulated with the ECC-lipids
model agree with experiments with the comparable accuracy to the other state of the art lipid models,
it also reproduces the experimental lipid head group order parameter responses to
the cationic surfactant, NaCl and CaCl$_2$ concentrations. 

The good agreement with experiments enables the atomic resolution 
interpretation of NMR experiments by using MD simulations.
In agreement with previous interpretations of experimental data \cite{hauser76,hauser78,herbette84,binder02},
the Ca$^{2+}$ ions mainly interact with phosphate oxygens.
However, the stoichiometry of the binding is significantly more complicated 
than in the previous interpretation of the NMR data based on 
the ternary complex model, where one calcium binds to two POPC molecules~\cite{altenbach84}.
The complexes of one calcium bound to two lipids are the most probable also in the
ECC-lipids model, but the complexes of one or three lipids per one calcium
were observed to be almost equally likely. While the success of the ternary
compex model is understandable based on the simulation results,
a simple binding model cannot detec the complex binding
oberved in the simulation.

The improved cation binding behaviour to POPC bilayer pave the way for
simulations of complex biochemical systems with correctly described
electrostatic interactions in the vicinity of cellular membranes.
The ECC-lipids model is build by scaling the partial charges
and the LJ-radius of the headgroup, glycerol backbone and carbonyl atoms of
the Lipid14 POPC model~\cite{dickson14} with the constant factor
of 0.8 and 0.89, respectively. While the Lipid14 model
is compatible with the AMBER force field family, the compatibility of
the ECC-lipids model may be compromised due to the changes in intermolecular
interactions of the scaled atoms. On the other hand, a fully consistent
ECC-force field should include the correction also in other than lipid
molecules, including water. The work toward this direction and the extension
to other lipid molecules and force fields is left for the future studies.

%but we expect that the correction can be used also for other lipids
%and force fields.

%We suggest using state of the art water models like OPC3\cite{Izadi16} or OPC \cite{Izadi14},
%which yield higher accuracy than the traditional TIP3p water model~\cite{jorgensen83}.
%Several water models 
%(OPC3\cite{Izadi16}, OPC \cite{Izadi14}, SPC/E \cite{Berendsen1987} and TIP4p/2005 \cite{Abascal2005}) 
%were used to exemplify the transferability of 
%the parameters of the new ECC-lipids force field.

\todo{This should be either done properly with the correct $C_I$ or removed. Removing
might be a better idea at this point.}
It was found in the original work~\cite{altenbach84} that 
a ternary complex binding model (i.e.~2~POPC:1~\ce{Ca^{2+}})
provides the best fit to experimental measurements of all considered models in that study. 
In such a model, there is a linear relationship between quantities 
$C_b$, mole fraction of bound \ce{Ca^{2+}} per POPC, and $\sqrt{C_b/C_I}$, 
where $C_I$ is the concentration of free cations at the plane of ion binding~\cite{altenbach84}.
The concentration $C_b$ was obtained from an extrapolation of linear relation 
between deuterium NMR measurements and atomic absorption spectroscopy for low concetrations of \ce{CaCl2}.
Such an extrapolation is valid as long as the mode of \ce{Ca^{2+}} binding 
remains constant throughout the extrapolation range. 
The concentration $C_I$ is determined by using the surface potential by using the Boltzmann equation.
However, Boltzmann theory yields inaccurate results
for divalent cations like \ce{Ca^{2+}}~\cite{Andelman1995}. 
An atomistic simulation, on the other hand, provides these quantities directly without severe assumptions.
Hence we hypothesise that the discrepancy between the results in the experiment~\cite{altenbach84} and 
our simulations likely lays in the fact that 
the assumptions and relations used for determinig concentrations $C_b$ and $C_I$ in the experiment~\cite{altenbach84}
gradually do not hold for higher concentrations of \ce{Ca^{2+}}.

    provides a good fit to experimental measurements~\cite{altenbach84}
    and it also provides a good fit to our simulation data. 
    Note that the units in the reference~\citenum{altenbach84} are different from the units presented here,
    and, hence, the observed slope of the linear relationship is different.
