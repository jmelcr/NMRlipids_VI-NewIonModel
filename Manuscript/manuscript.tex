Binding affinities and stoichiometries of Na$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$ ions to phospholipid
bilayers are of paramount significance in the properties and functionality of cellular
membranes. For example, possible accumulation of ions at the membrane interface determines
the interaction affinity with charged species. Current estimates of binding affinities and
stoichiometries of cations are controversial due to limitations in the experimental and
theoretical methods available. Experimentally one can assess these parameters by titrating
several membrane properties as a function of the ions concentration. However, the
interpretation of the obtained results requires theoretical models. Considering that the
real behavior is unknown these models are at best idealizations. Classical molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations provide details of the ions binding process with atomistic
resolution. Therefore, MD a priory offers all necessary information to interpret
experimental data without the need to resort to simplified models. However, the accuracy
of the available lipid models when interacting with ions is currently limited. In this
work, we improve the binding details of Na$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$ ions to the
1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine POPC) bilayer by implicitly including electronic
polarization. We do this by applying a mean field correction to the partial charges known
as the electronic continuum correction (ECC) to a selected state of the art POPC lipid
model for MD simulations. Our improved ECC-POPC model reproduces not only the
experimentally measured structural parameters for the ion-free membrane, but also the
response of lipid headgroup to a bound positive charge, and the binding affinities of 
Na$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$ ions. We also observe negligible binding of Na$^+$ ions to POPC
bilayer and stronger interactions of Ca$^{2+}$ primarily with phosphate oxygens in our new
model is in agreement with available experimental spectroscopic data. This new model
results in Ca$^{2+}$ ions forming complexes with one to three POPC molecules with almost
equal probabilities which suggests that previous models used to interpret NMR data are too
simple. The results of this work pave the way to quantitative MD simulations of complex
biochemical systems with realistic electrostatic interactions in the vicinity of cellular
membranes.

\section{Introduction}
Ions interactions with cellular membranes play a key role in critical biological processes~\cite{REF_REVIEW}. Ions, especially cations, modify general properties of the membrane which ultimately modulate their embedded transmembrane proteins~\cite{REF}. Ions also have a more direct effect by modulating lipid--, protein--, and sugar--lipid interactions at the membrane surface. For example, Ca$^{2+}$  is crucial in neural signal propagation. It promotes membrane fusion by bridging lipids in the vesicles carrying neurotransmitters and the neuron synapsis membrane~\cite{REF}. Ca$^{2+}$ also participates in the T-cell receptor activation. It induces the detachment of the positively charged cytosolic tails of the CD3 protein complex from the negatively charged intracellular membrane making it accessible for Lck protein~\cite{Shi2013}. A final example involving sugar-lipid interactions mediated by ions is that Ca$^{2+}$ can modulate the presentation of the sugars found in the PI(4,5)P$_2$ lipid which ultimately modulates phospholipase C delta 1 pleckstrin homology domain (PLC $\delta$1-H)~\cite{Bilkova2017Calcium}. Interestingly, this modulation is lost when using Mg$^{2+}$ instead of Ca$^{2+}$ illustrating the selectivity of these processes towards particular ions. Despite our increasing understanding of the role of ions in cell membrane-related processes the exact molecular details of the mechanisms behind such processes remain elusive.

Direct measurements of ion-membrane interactions in real biological systems are difficult. Simplified lipid bilayers are often used instead as entry-level models to shed light on the role of ions in complex biological membranes~\cite{scherer87,seelig90,cevc90}. For this reason, interactions of biologically relevant cations, especially Na$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$, with zwitterionic phosphocholine (PC) bilayers have been widely studied in experiments~\cite{akutsu81, altenbach84, seelig90, cevc90, tocanne90, binder02, pabst07, uhrikova08} and classical MD simulations~\cite{bockmann03, bockmann04, Berkowitz12, melcrova16, javanainen17}. The details of ion binding are, however, not fully consistent in the literature. Non-invasive spectroscopic methods, like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), scattering, and infrared spectroscopies mainly suggest that Na$^+$ ions exhibit negligible binding to PC lipid bilayers. On the contrary, Ca$^{2+}$ is observed to specifically bind to a couple of PC molecules using their phosphate groups~\cite{hauser76, hauser78, herbette84, akutsu81, altenbach84, binder02, pabst07, uhrikova08}. On the other hand, {\color{red} in general} \todo{Not CHARMM36 or amber14} atomistic resolution molecular dynamics (MD) simulation models predict a stronger binding for the cations~\cite{catte16}. For example, simulations report Na$^+$ accumulating in the lipid interface~\cite{bockmann03} or Ca$^{2+}$ binding up to 4 PC lipids simultaneously, including not only interactions with phosphates but also with carbonyl oxygens~\cite{bockmann04, melcrova16, javanainen17}. {\color{red} Also, several experiments have also been interpreted to support the predictions from earlier MD simulations~\cite{bockmann03, vacha09a}. \todo{remove? Why we need this?}}

Recent studies within the NMRlipids project \url{nmrlipids.blogspot.fi})~\cite{catte16} made an attempt to resolve these apparent controversies. A direct comparison of ion binding affinities to PC bilayers between simulations and experiments was performed using the electrometer concept. Namely, the changes in NMR order parameters of the headgroup upon ions additions~\cite{seelig87} is directly compared to the MD simulations results. Analyzing massive amounts of data collected by the Open Collaboration method, it was concluded that the accuracy of the current state of the art lipid models for MD simulations is not sufficient for a detailed interpretation of the interactions of cations with PC lipid bilayers~\cite{catte16}.

In this work, we improve the cation binding of a POPC bilayer in MD simulations via the implicit inclusion of the electronic polarizability in the polar region of phospholipids. For this, we apply a simple mean-field electronic continuum correction (ECC)~\cite{leontyev11} which implies scaling the partial charges of the atoms to account for the missing electronic polarizability in MD simulations~\cite{leontyev11}. Such an approach has been previously shown to improve the behavior of ions in bulk water simulations ~\cite{jungwirth17-new-paper-to-be-published, Pluharova2014, kohagen14, kohagen16}. As a starting template for our POPC model, we will use the Lipid14~\cite{dickson14}. This force field provides one of the best available descriptions of cation binding \cite{catte16}. The newly developed ECC-lipids model reproduces the experimentally
measurable structural parameters of an ion-free POPC lipid bilayer with the accuracy comparable to the best state of the art lipid models, while improving the membrane binding affinities significantly to sodium and calcium cations.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Electronic continuum correction for lipid bilayers}\label{section:ecc}
The lack of electronic polarizability in standard MD simulation force fields has been considered a serious issue since the early days of lipid bilayer simulations. In this work, we circumvent the demanding explicit inclusion of electronic polarization effects~\cite{lucas12, chowdhary13} by including the electronic part of polarizability in lipid bilayer simulations implicitly via the electronic continuum correction (ECC)~\cite{leontyev11}. Technically, this is similar to the phenomenological charge-scaling applied in earlier studies of aqueous solutions or ionic liquids \cite{jonsson86, egberts94, beichel14}. However, the present concept of ECC is physically well justified and rigorously derived~\cite{leontyev09, leontyev10, leontyev11, leontyev14}.

According to ECC mean-field correction, for atomic ions, the electronic polarizability can be modeled in non-polarizable MD by effectively embedding the ions in a homogeneous dielectric continuum with a dielectric constant $\epsilon_{el}$, which is the electronic part of the dielectric constant of the medium~\cite{leontyev11}. Following Coulomb's law,  we can directly incorporate the results by scaling the charges with a constant scaling factor of $f_q = \epsilon _{el} ^{-1/2}$.

\begin{equation}
Q^{ECC} = f_q \cdot Q ,
\end{equation}

Given that the  high frequency dielectric constant of water is $\epsilon _{el} = 1.78$ (\textit{i.e.,} the square of the refraction index), the scaling factor for ions in water is roughly $f_q \approx 0.75$. This scaling factor successfully improves the accuracy of the simulation of solvated ions \cite{kohagen14, kohagen16, REF}, when quantitatively compared with neutron scattering data \cite{kohagen14,kohagen16, Pluharova2014}.

While using a scaling factor of $f_q = 0.75$ for ions in water is well justified in the ECC theory \cite{Leontyev2011}, it is not clear whether the same factor should be applied to partial charges used to describe molecules in MD models, e.g., lipids in our case. Unlike the total charge of an ion, atomic partial charges within molecules are not physical observables. Several schemes exist for the assignment of partial charges for biomolecules~\cite{Hu2007}, where the restrained electrostatic potential method (RESP) is the most commonly used~\cite{RESP_paper, Singh1984}. Considering that RESP charges are usually refined to improve certain experimental observables, to some extent,  the electronic polarizability effect of the solvent is included in modern force fields~\cite{RESP_paper, Singh1984, jorgensen96, ipolq2013, benavides17}. Thus, the application of the ECC scaling factor, $f_q$, to the existing partial charges in molecules does not universally follow $f_q = \epsilon _{el} ^{-1/2}$. Instead, a consistent scaling factor would lie between the value of 0.75  (\textit{i.e.,} no electronic polarizability included in the original partial charges) and 1 (\textit{i.e.,} electronic polarizability fully included in the original partial charges). It is important to note that the electronic part of polarizability is around 2 for almost any biologically relevant environment \cite{some_original_work, leontyev11}.

Here we develop ECC-POPC lipid model that accurately describes the binding of sodium and calcium ions to the resulting lipid bilayer. We applied the ECC correction to the Lipid14 model of POPC by scaling of partial charges of the head group, glycerol backbone, and carbonyl regions. These are the polar parts of phospholipids which can contribute to the cation binding. The Lipid14~\cite{dickson14} force field parameters (available in a Gromacs format from Ref. \citenum{lipid14files}) were used as a starting point. This model provides the best response of the head group to ions among the available lipid models (see Figs.~2~and~5 in Ref.~\citenum{catte16}). Additionally, the Lipid14 model has a relatively realistic head group, glycerol backbone, and tails structure~\cite{botan15}.

To develop the ECC-POPC model, we scanned the optimal interval for the scaling factor, $f_q~\in~(0.75, 1.0)$, to reproduce the experimental ion binding affinities. In general, scaling down the partial charges reduces the ion binding affinity and the head group order parameter response which can be measured using NMR~\cite{akutsu81, altenbach84, scherer89}. We found an optimal value $f_q = 0.8$, which is only slightly higher the theoretical one ($f_q=0.75$). Directly applying the 0.8 scaling to the partial charges of the head group, the glycerol backbone, and the carbonyls reduces the area per lipid to 60~\AA$^2$. This area is smaller than the original in Lipid14 model ($65.6 \pm 0.5$~\AA$^2$)~\cite{dickson14} and the experimental value (64.3~\AA$^2$) \cite{kucerka11}. The decrease of the area per lipid arises from a reduced hydration of the lipid head group region after scaling charges which effectively reduces head group polarity. 
We solve this difficulty by reducing the effective radii of the modified atoms by lowering the $\sigma$ parameters in the Lennard-Jones potential by a factor of $f_\sigma = 0.89$. The same solution was taken for the ECC-ions in solution \cite{kohagen14, kohagen16, Pluharova2014}. After reducing the $\sigma$ parameters, the area per molecule is restored to the experimental value (Table~\ref{tab:apls}). 




\subsection{Electrometer concept} \label{section:electrometer}
Comparing MD simulation to NMR experiments, we can validate the simulation ion binding affinity to lipid bilayers using the ''electrometer concept''~ \cite{seelig87, catte16}. This method relies on the experimental observation that the C-H bond order parameters of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbons in a PC lipid head group (Fig.~\ref{simVSexpNOions}) are proportional to the amount of charge bound per lipid~\cite{seelig87}. Comparing this response is an excellent way to validate force fields as both NMR and MD can accurately determine order parameters ~\cite{catte16, ollila16}. The order parameters for all C-H bonds in lipid molecules can be accurately measured using $^2$H NMR or $^{13}$C NMR techniques \cite{ollila16}. From MD simulations the order parameters can be calculated using the definition
\begin{equation}\label{OP}
S_{\rm CH}=\frac{3}{2}\langle \cos^2\theta -1 \rangle,
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the angle between the C-H bond and membrane normal. Angular brackets point to the average over all sampled configurations.

The relation between the amount of the bound charge per lipid, $X^\pm$, and the head group order parameter change, $\Delta S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}$, is empirically quantified as~\cite{seelig87,ferreira16}
\begin{equation}\label{OPchangeEQ}
\Delta S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}= S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}(X^\pm)-S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}(0) \approx m_i \frac{4 }{3\chi}X^\pm,
\end{equation}
where $i$ refers to either $\alpha$ or $\beta$ carbon, $S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}(0)$ denote the order parameter in the absence of bound charge, $\chi$ is the quadrupole coupling constant ($\chi \approx$\,167\,kHz), and $m_i$ empirical experimental constant depending on the valency and position of the bound charge.


The measured change of the order parameter depends both on the head group response to the bound charge and on the amount of the bound charge (\textit{i.e.,} $m_i$ and $X^\pm$ in Eq.~\ref{OPchangeEQ}, respectively).  The empirical factor $m_i$ has to be adequately quantified before the electrometer concept can be used to analyze the binding affinities. This calibration has been done experimentally for a wide range of systems~\cite{seelig87, beschiasvili91}. To calibrate the response of the head group order parameter to the bound charge in simulations, we use experimental data for a strong cationic surfactant dihexadecyldimethylammoniumbromide  (DHAB) bilayer~\cite{scherer89}. DHAB\\[0.5cm]

is a cationic surfactant having two acyl chains and bearing a unit charge in the hydrophilic end. Thus, it is expected to locate in the bilayer similarly to the phospholipids, and its molar ratio then gives directly the amount of bound unit charge per lipid $X^\pm$ in these systems~\cite{scherer89}.

\subsection{Salt concentrations and binding affinity}
NMR experiments report the used salt concentrations in two different ways when measuring head group order parameters. Some use the salt concentrations in water before solvating the lipids~\cite{akutsu81} while others use atomic absorption spectroscopy and report the salt concentration in the supernatant after the solvation of lipids~\cite{altenbach84}. In this work, we use the latter definition. In particular, we measure the salt concentration in the aqueous bulk region as that at the farthest point from the lipid bilayer in the aqueous phase. Notice that this definition differs from the one used by Catte et al.~\cite{catte16} where the former definition is used. Although these two definitions vary when applied to Ca$^{2+}$, they do not affect significantly the conclusions of this work.

To quantify the ion binding affinities to a lipid bilayer, we calculate the relative surface excess of ions with respect to water, $\Gamma_{ion}^{water}$~\cite{chattorajBOOK}. Such a quantity compares the adsorption of ions to the adsorption of water molecules at the interface without the necessity of defining a Gibbs dividing plane between the membrane interior and the water bulk region. In our simulations, we only assume that the interface is located between the ion-free hydrophobic interior of the lipid bilayer and the aqueous region far from the membrane.  Such a setup and the above definition of bulk ion concentration provide a simple relation for the relative surface excess $\Gamma_{ion}^{water}$ for simulations of lipid bilayers,
 
\begin{equation}\label{surfexcess}
  \Gamma_{ion}^{water}=\frac{1}{2A_b} \left ( n_{ion} - n_{water} \frac{C_{ion}}{C_{water}} \right ).
\end{equation}
Here, $n_{water}$ and $n_{ion}$ are the total numbers of water molecules and ions in the system,
$C_{water}$ and $C_{ion}$ are their respective bulk concentrations in the aqueous phase,
and $A_b$ is the area of the unit cell in the membrane plane.
The total area of the interface is then twice the area of the membrane, i.e., $2A_b$,
because the bilayer has an interface at each of the two leaflets.



\subsection{Validation of lipid bilayer structure against NMR and scattering experiments}
The structures of lipid bilayers in simulations without ions were validated against NMR by calculating the order parameters for the C-H bonds and \mbox{x-ray} scattering experiments by the scattering form factors. NMR order parameters validate the structures sampled by the individual lipid molecules with atomic resolution. The simulated order parameters were calculated for all C-H bonds in lipid molecules from Eq. \ref{OP}. Scattering form factors validate the dimensions of the lipid bilayer (e.g., thickness and area per molecule). Form factors were calculated using

\begin{equation}
  F(q) = \int _{-D/2} ^{D/2} \left ( \rho_{el}(z) - \rho_{el}^s \right ) \cos (zq_z) \mathrm{d}z,
  %F(q) = \int _{-D/2} ^{D/2} \left ( \sum _\alpha f_\alpha (q_z) n_\alpha (z) - \rho _s \right ) \exp (izq_z) \mathrm{d}z,
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\rho_{el} (z)$ is the total electron density, $\rho_{el}^s$ is the electron density of the solvent far in the aqueous bulk, and $z$ is the distance from the membrane center along its normal with $D/2$ being half of the unit cell size.  




\subsection{Simulation details}

\subsubsection{Simulations of POPC bilayers with aqueous ions}
Simulations of a POPC bilayer in pure water or at varying salt concentrations consisted of 128 POPC molecules and approximately 50~SPC/E~water~\cite{Berendsen1987} molecules per lipid in an orthorhombic simulation box with periodic boundary conditions.  The chosen SPC/E water model, also used in the previous parametrization of ECC-ions \cite{jungwirth17-new-paper-to-be-published, kohagen16, Pluharova2014}, has a lowered dielectric constant, consistent with the ECC concept~\cite{leontyev11, leontyev14}.  We checked other water models (OPC \cite{Izadi14}, OPC3~\cite{Izadi16}, TIP3P~\cite{jorgensen83}, TIP3p-FB and TIP4p-FB~\cite{Wang2014}, and TIP4p/2005 \cite{Abascal2005}) to confirm the robustness of our approach (See SI). Sodium, calcium, and chloride ions were modeled as ECC-ions with parameters from Ref. \citenum{jungwirth17-new-paper-to-be-published, Pluharova2014}.  
% cite order: [Ca_2s, Na_s, Cl_2s] 
Scaled charges and van der Waals radii for atoms forming the POPC lipid are derived in this work starting from the Lipid14 force field~\cite{REF}. For comparison, simulations with unscaled charges were performed using the Lipid14 model~\cite{REF}, the TIP3p model for water \cite{jorgensen83}\todo{HECTOR: Do we compare this against scaled with SPC or TIP3P?}, and ion models by Dang and coworkers~\cite{smith94,chang1999,dang2006}. Simulation data for the Lipid14 model with \AA{}qvist ions~\cite{aqvist90} and TIP3P~\cite{jorgensen83} water models were taken directly from Ref.~\citenum{catte16}.  

MD simulations were performed using the GROMACS \cite{Abraham15} simulation package (version 5.1.4). The simulation settings employed in this work are summarized in Table \ref{tbl:mdpar}\todo{HECTOR: Is this the SI? If so we have to indicate it. Now reference is weird.}. The simulated trajectories and parameters files are available at \cite{??} \todo{To be uploaded to Zenodo}.



\subsubsection{Simulations of POPC bilayers with cationic surfactants}
The topology of dihexadecyldimethylammonium was created with the automated topology builder \cite{malde11}. The AmberTools program~\cite{amber} was then used to generate the Amber-type force field parameters. These parameters were then converted to the Gromacs format with the acpype tool \cite{acpype}. The partial charges were then manually modified in the non-scaled version~\cite{catte16} to approximately match similar segments in Lipid14 \cite{dickson14}. For simulation with ECC-POPC, the partial charges of the headgroup were scaled, i.e., $f_q=0.8$, and the $\sigma$ of the scale atoms reduced as in POPC-ECC.

The cationic surfactants were randomly mixed among the phospholipids to form bilayer structures with mole fractions of 10\%, 20\%, 30\%, 42\%, or 50\% of surfactant in the POPC bilayer. All these systems contained 50 POPC molecules per leaflet, 6340 TIP3P~\cite{jorgensen83} water molecules, and 6, 14, 21, 35, or 50 surfactants per leaflet.  Chloride counter ions were used in simulations, while bromide was the counter ion in the experiment \cite{scherer89}. For POPC either the Lipid14 or ECC-POPC model was used. The first 20~ns of the total simulation time of 200~ns was considered as an equilibration time and was omitted from the analysis. Sufficient lipid neighbor exchange occurred during the simulations. Further details for the unscaled simulations and the trajectories are in Ref.~\citenum{catte16}.

First, we present results for bilayers in pure water.
The ECC-lipids and Lipid14 models both reproduce the experimental x-ray scattering form factors
of a POPC bilayer with a comparable accuracy in Fig.~\ref{simVSexpNOions}.
The area per lipid from the Lipid14 model is $\approx$1\AA{} larger than the
experimental value in Table~\ref{tab:apls}, while the value from the ECC-lipids model
is $\approx$1\AA{} smaller\todo{The 63.2 value does not appear in the SI table. There it is 62.2 but I'm not sure corresponds to the same system}. The values of the area per lipid of the ECC-lipids model show larger variations
when simulated with different water models (i.e., 62.2--66.8 \AA{}, see Table~\ref{tab:apls_si} in SI\todo{HECTOR: change to real reference in SI}),
while still being close to the experimentally reported values.
We can thus conclude that the ECC-lipids model reproduces the experimental dimensions of the POPC
lipid bilayer with accuracy comparable to that for another state of the art lipid models \cite{ollila16}.
%The optimal value for $f_\sigma$ was found by representing the overall membrane structure well
%by matching scattering form factors to experimental data~\cite{Petrache06, Kucerka08, Pabst10}.

Similarly, the acyl chain order parameters of the ECC-lipids model, as well as the Lipid14 model~\cite{dickson14}, agree with the experimental values within the error bars, as presented in Fig.~\ref{simVSexpNOions}. Notably, the experimentally measured forking and small order parameter values of $C_2$ segment in {\it sn}-2 chain are well reproduced by both models. This feature has been suggested to indicate that the carbonyl of {\it sn}-2 chain is directed towards the water phase, in contrast to the carbonyl in {\it sn}-1 chain, which would orient more along the bilayer plane~\cite{seelig75,schindler75,gawrisch92}. This arrangement may be a relevant feature for the ion binding details, which it is not fully reproduced by other available lipid models~\cite{ollila16}.
%This is expected as the ECC model does not modify the already highly optimized parameters of this region in Lipid14

The order parameters of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbons in the headgroup are slightly larger in the ECC-lipids model than in the Lipid14 model, which is apparently related to the P-N vector orienting by about 7$^{\circ}$ more toward the water phase in the ECC-lipids model, see Fig.~\ref{OrderParameterCHANGESsurf}. Considering the available experimental evidence, it is not possible to suggest which of the two models provides more realistic headgroup orientation. The ECC-lipids model gives the $\beta$ carbon order parameter value closer to experiments than the Lipid14 model, while the opposite is true for the $\alpha$ carbon. The accuracy of both models in the glycerol backbone region is equally footed with any other state of art lipid model available in literature \cite{botan15}, see Fig.~\ref{simVSexpNOions}.

  }
\end{figure}

Before studying the sodium and calcium ion binding affinities, we have to quantify as reference the response of the headgroup order parameters to the amount of bound charge by using mixtures of monovalent cationic surfactants (dihexadecyldimethylammonium) and POPC~\cite{scherer89}. These mixtures have a well-defined amount of bound charge per PC, i.e., the molar fraction of cationic surfactants. This direct relation results from the ability of dihexadecyldimethylammonium to be inserted in the lipid bilayers as any lipid because of its two hydrophobic acyl chains. Furthermore, available experimental data for these systems can be used to validate the sensitivity of lipid headgroup order parameters to the amount of bound charge in simulations \cite{REF}.

The changes of the headgroup order parameters with increasing amount of the cationic surfactant are compared between simulations and experiments~\cite{scherer89} in Fig.~\ref{OrderParameterCHANGESsurf}. An approximately linear decrease of the order parameters, as expected from Eq. \ref{OPchangeEQ}, is observed in both simulations and experiments at least for mole fractions below $\sim$30\%. The slope is, however, too steep in the Lipid14 model indicating that the head group order parameters response is too large to the bound positive charge. In contrast, the slope of the ECC-lipids model is in a very good agreement with experiments for the $\alpha$ segment, while being slightly underestimated for the $\beta$ segment.

In Fig.~\ref{OrderParameterCHANGESsurf}, we show the headgroup P-N vector angle as a function of the mole fraction of the cationic surfactant. As suggested previously~\cite{seelig87}, the headgroup orients more towards the water phase with the increasing amount of positive charge in a PC lipid bilayer. The effect is more pronounced in the Lipid14 model than in the ECC-POPC model.   For example, the addition of 50\% mole fraction of the cationic surfactant leads to the decrease of 20$^{\circ}$ of the P-N vector angle for the Lipid14 model while only 11$^{\circ}$ in the ECC-POPC model. The difference is in line with the smaller order parameter changes and the reduced charge--dipole interactions in the latter model. The lower sensitivity of the P-N vector angle response in the ECC-POPC model agrees better with experiments. The results imply that improvements are required in MD models for reliable studies of the lipid headgroup responses to ions or other biomolecules{\color{red}, as also suggested previously \cite{botan15}} \todo{Do you want to finish each paragraph with a citation to your previous works?}.

Changes of the lipid bilayer head group order parameters from different simulations and experiments \cite{akutsu81, altenbach84} are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_NaCl} and~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl} as functions of NaCl or CaCl$_2$ concentrations.
%Responses to NaCl concentrations are in SI, Fig.~S\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_NaCl}.
These results can be used to compare the ion binding affinities to lipid bilayers between simulations and experiments using the electrometer concept because the order parameters decrease proportionally to the amount of the bound positive charge (Fig.~\ref{OrderParameterCHANGESsurf} and Ref.~\citenum{seelig87, catte16}). A recent comparison of different simulation models to the experimental data revealed that most force fields significantly overestimate Na$^+$ ion binding to PC lipid bilayers and that none of the available models correctly reproduces the details of the binding of Ca$^{2+}$ ions which is grossly overestimated \cite{catte16}. Only the Lipid14 model \cite{dickson14} simulated with \AA{}qvist ions reproduces the experimentally measured small order parameter changes with NaCl (Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_NaCl}) and the negligible Na$^+$ binding to PC bilayers \cite{akutsu81, altenbach84}. Since artifacts were reported in simulations involving \AA{}qvist ions is water \cite{auffinger07}, we tested the Lipid14 model with more realistic Na$^+$ models by Dang et al.~\cite{smith94, chang1999, dang2006}. In this case, overbinding reappeared (Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_NaCl}).The results are in line with the previous work \cite{catte16}, suggesting that additional improvements in the lipid parameters are required to describe the binding of cations to phospholipid bilayers correctly.

%To improve the cation binding behaviour to POPC lipid bilayer we implicitly included the electronic
%polarization to the Lipid14 model by using the ECC approach as described in section \ref{section:ecc}.

The results from the simulations combining the ECC-lipids with the ECC-ion models \cite{jungwirth17-new-paper-to-be-published, kohagen16, Pluharova2014} exhibit a significantly improved behavior of the POPC head group order parameters as functions of NaCl or CaCl$_2$ concentrations, see Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_NaCl} and Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl}. Considering that we can also reproduce the experimental response in systems with known charge density (see above section \ref{section:boundCHARGE}), we conclude that our ECC-model correctly reproduces the binding affinities of Na$^{+}$ and Ca$^{2+}$ ions to the POPC lipid bilayer. Furthermore, while the response of the glycerol backbone $g_3$ order parameter to CaCl$_2$ was significantly overestimated in the original Lipid14 model, the ECC-lipids model provides an improved agreement with experiment, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl}.

\todo{HECTOR: I do not believe in the content of the following sentence as it is. How do we know that the changes of the P-N angle are too pronounced for Lipid14?. There is no direct correlation between angle and order parameter.} 
Also the changes of the P-N vector angle are too pronounced for the Lipid14 model, for which the largest tilting toward water phase induced by a $780\,\mathrm{mM}$ CaCl$_2$ concentration is approximately 17$^{\circ}$, while the corresponding value for ECC-lipids model is only 6$^{\circ}$ ($820\,\mathrm{mM}$ CaCl$_2$). 
\todo{HECTOR: I have a problem when comparing fig. 2 and 3. If I read it right the behavior when adding calcium and surfactant is not the same. Is the latter changing the area per lipid and therefore the surface charge density? If this will be the case then besides the effect of the charge we will have a packing effect. This is more relevant for the more concentrated cases. Shouldn't we try to discuss the two figures and what the differences and similarities mean? Given our previous work, should we check the behavior respect the charge density?}

Within the Lipid14 model, the overestimated changes in the lipid headgroup order parameter of POPC  as functions of the CaCl$_2$ concentration arise both from the overestimated binding affinity and the excessive sensitivity of the headgroup tilt to the bound positive charge. It is plausible that the same applies to the other lipid models tested in a previous study~\cite{catte16}, which underlines the importance to validate the lipid headgroup order parameter response to the bound charge. 

Finally, the ion binding affinities for the ECC-lipids model with different water models are compared in SI. In general, the performance of ECC-lipids with any of the water models is better than that of the original Lipid14 model, with the order parameter changes being slightly overestimated with the four-site water models and with TIP3p model.

Binding affinities of Ca$^{2+}$ ions to a POPC bilayer in different simulation models were quantified by calculating the relative surface excess of calcium respect to water molecules, $\Gamma_{\rm ion}^{\rm water}$, from Eq.~\ref{surfexcess}. The values of $\Gamma_{\rm ion}^{\rm water}$, shown in Table~\ref{tab:binding}, were calculated from simulations with the same initial concentration of CaCl$_2$ of 350~mM before solvating the lipids. As expected from the changes of the lipid headgroup order parameters in Fig.~ \ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl}, the relative surface excess for the ECC-lipids model, $\Gamma_{\rm Ca}^{\rm water}$ = 0.06~nm$^{-2}$, is significantly smaller than for the other models, 0.13--0.35~nm$^{-2}$. \todo{HECTOR: I have deleted the sentence relating the uncertainty and the error as in my opinion there are other factors which are more important. The most important the slow convergence.}. Interestingly, the calculated relative surface excess of \ce{NaCl} at $1\,\mathrm{M}$ concentration (ECC-ions~\cite{Pluharova2014}) using our POPC-ECC model is not only quantitatively but also qualitatively different from \ce{CaCl2} having a negative value $\Gamma_{Na}^{water} = (-0.11 \pm 0.01) \rm{nm}^{-2}$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl-dens}). This value means that water molecules are preferred to sodium and chloride ions at the membrane-water interface.  This is in contradiction with most of the available lipid force fields, which predict a positive binding of sodium to PC lipid bilayers \cite{catte16}. \todo{do we need to add a NaCl table or an extended table for CaCl2 using different concentrations in the SI?

We analyzed the ratio of the number of calcium cations bound to either phosphate or carbonyl moieties and the total number of bound cations in our POPC bilayers as done previously in Ref.~\citenum{javanainen17}. A maximum distance of 0.3~nm from any lipid oxygen is used to determine a bound calcium. The results in Table~\ref{tab:binding} show that almost all (99\%) of the bound Ca$^{2+}$ ions are in contact with the phosphate oxygens. From those only one third (32\%) also interact with the carbonyl oxygens. The interaction between calcium ions with only carbonyl oxygens is rare (1\%). Neither individual lipids nor source chain of carbonyl is distinguished in the analysis. The most likely interactions between Ca$^{2+}$ ions and phosphate oxygens are visualized with the probability density isocontours in Fig.~\ref{fig:volmaps}. While higher concentrations of \ce{CaCl2} increase the number of contacts per lipid, the distribution of contacts between phosphate and carbonyl oxygens is not affected.

Even though \ce{Na+} ions do not specifically bind to a POPC bilayer, they still interact mostly with its oxygen moieties. The results from the simulation at $1\,$M \ce{NaCl} concentration show that 55\% of \ce{Na+} ions interact with only phosphate oxygens of POPC and 20\% with only carbonyl oxygens, and the rest, 25\%, is interacting with both.

In conclusion, the results suggest that calcium ions bind specifically to phosphate oxygens, occasionally interacting also with carbonyls. This is in good agreement with previous conclusions from several experimental and computational studies~\cite{hauser76, hauser78, herbette84, cevc90, binder02}, but suggesting a lower relative binding affinity to the carbonyls than inferred from previous MD simulation studies~\cite{bockmann03, bockmann04, melcrova16, javanainen17}. Sodium ions also interact primarily with phosphate oxygens of the POPC, but in contrast to calcium, the interactions purely with carbonyls are also significant. \todo{This last sentence is weak and not relevant. If you want to keep it go ahead, but then I would ask you a simple question: Is it incompatible to have no overall binding (this relates to the whole surface volume) with having small cavities in the membrane with an increase Na+ concentration. If the answer is negative maybe the statement is incorrect and who knows it might be relevant for something. After all even Ca2+ affinity changes in the presence of sodium.} The physiological relevance of these details of sodium interactions is, however, unclear due to its overall very weak binding affinity.

\subsection{Binding stoichiometry of \ce{Na+} and \ce{Ca^{2+}} cations to the POPC membrane}

%Binding probability:
%\ce{Ca2+} complex with \\
%1 POPC - 13\% -- 30\% \\
%2 POPC - 18\% -- 42\% \\
%3 POPC - 12\% -- 28\% \\

Simple binding models have been used previously to interpret the experimental data \cite{altenbach84,macdonald87} we use in this work to validate the simulation models (Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl}). In particular, NMR data about PC headgroup order parameters response and atomic absorption spectroscopy were best explained using a ternary complex binding model with a binding stoichiometry of one \ce{Ca^{2+}} per two POPC lipids~\cite{altenbach84}. However, a Langmuir adsorption model assuming a \ce{Ca^{2+}}:POPC stoichiometry of 1:1 also provided a good fit to the experimental data when considering only \ce{CaCl2}low concentrations~\cite{macdonald87}. \todo{HECTOR: Why is the following sentence remotely significant. I will vote for removing it} Note that the results based on these binding models and the measured headgroup order parameter changes are also included in the tabulated experimental binding constants~\cite{marsh13}.

In this work, we reproduce the same experimental data used to calculate binding stoichiometry with our ECC-POPC model. Using our simulations, we have direct access to exact details of the binding stoichiometry without requiring any middle model as in experiments~\cite{altenbach84, macdonald87}. To evaluate the relative propensities for each stoichiometric complex (e.i., 1 Ca$^{2+}$: n POPC), we calculated for each bound Ca$^{2+}$ the number of POPC molecules within a distance of 0.3~nm.  In Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl_complexes}, from the POPC bilayer simulation with a 285~mM bulk concentration of CaCl$_2$ we found that the largest propensity is for the 1:2 complex (41\%). \todo {I seriously doubt that this is what they call a ternary complex but correct me if you know better}. Still, the probabilities of complexes with the stoichiometries of 1:1~(25\%)~and 1:3~(34\%)~are only slightly lower. This variability suggests a more complex binding model than the previously considered in a simple ternary complex model. With a broad brushstroke, the simulation data can, however, be viewed such that one calcium binds to two lipids on average, because the probabilities of the complexes with 1 or 3 lipids are almost equal to each other  (and complexes with more than three lipids per one calcium ion were not observed). This probably explains why the simple the ternary complex model fits adequately the experimental data, as well as the ECC-POPC simulation results (see Fig.~S\ref{fig:cacl-bind} in SI).

The probabilities of different complexes formed by \ce{Na+} ions and POPC
analyzed from the simulation with the ECC-lipids model at $1\,$M concentration of NaCl are also 
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl_complexes}. In contrast to calcium, the
probability is largest (67\%) for 1:1 complex, significantly smaller (29\%)
for 1:2 complexes and very small (4\%) for 1:3 of \ce{Na+}:POPC complexes.




\subsection{Residence times of \ce{Na+} and \ce{Ca^{2+}} cations in POPC membrane}

Equilibration of \ce{Ca^{2+}} ions at a POPC bilayer in MD simulations is a microsecond time scale process with current state of the art force fields, e.g., CHARMM36 and Slipids force fields~\cite{javanainen17}. This suggests that at least several microseconds are required to reach the binding/unbinding equilibrium. \todo{HECTOR: I disagree with the following lines. In the case of most of the unscale force fields the issue is that the binding of Calcium to the membrane is very strong. Therefore, the reorganization takes too long leading to a very slow equilibration process. In this case, the size of the hill in the choline region is nothing compared to the size between the bound and solvated state which is the real bottleneck. Even in the case of the scaled simulations, I believe the same applies but to a lesser extent. I might be wrong in this last part. If you do not agree we can discuss it tomorrow via skype.} {\color {red} This is in line with the density profiles of \ce{Ca^{2+}} from simulations in Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl-dens}, which all show a region of a very small calcium density around the level of choline groups in POPC (i.e., around $2.5\,\mathrm{nm}$). In contrast, simulations with  ECC-lipids exhibits only a relatively shallow local minimum at that level. This suggests that the smaller barrier for the exchange of calcium ions shall lead to their faster exchange with the solvent within ECC-lipids.} To quantify the exchange of ions between the membrane and solvent in simulations, we thus calculated residence times of ions bound to the membrane. In our analysis, an ion is considered to be bound when it is within 0.3~nm from any oxygen atom belonging to a POPC molecule.

\todo{HECTOR: I do fully understand the content of this paragraph. I will discuss this with Joe tomorrow. Please be carefull with my changes.} The histograms of residence times of \ce{Ca^{2+}} ($C_w$ = 450~nM) in a POPC bilayer for simulations using either ECC-POPC or CHARMM36 (Simulation from Ref.~\citenum{javanainen17}) are shown in Fig.~S\ref{fig:hist_residence_times} in SI. In the CHARMM36 simulation, a significant number of the calciums are bound for the whole length of the trajectory ({\color{red} 800~ns}). In contrast, at least an order of magnitude faster bound/unbound calcium exchange is observed within the ECC-lipids model, where 90\% of the \ce{Ca^{2+}} residence times to a POPC membrane are shorter than $60\,\mathrm{ns}$. The longest observed residence time is around 150~ns, which is well below the total length of the simulation used for analysis, i.e., 200~ns. Note that these results are in line with the experimental estimate that the residence time of \ce{Ca^{2+}} at each PC headgroup is shorter than $10\,\mu\mathrm{s}$~\cite{altenbach84}. The exchange of \ce{Na+} ions at the POPC membrane is another order of magnitude faster, yielding 90\% of the residence times smaller than~1~ns, with the longest residence time being~6~ns.

%because it is limited by the simulation length, 
%even though it can be very long (order of $\mu\mathrm{s}$) in some works, e.g. reference~\citenum{javanainen17}. 
%Increasing time scales to the order of $\mu\mathrm{s}$ 
%doesn't help to alleviate such a problem in current lipid models \cite{javanainen17}. %and also \cite{catte16}, but same simulation was used. 

In conclusion, the results from the ECC-lipids model suggest that the exchange of calcium between the POPC bilayer and the solvent occurs within $\sim$100~ns timeframe, which is significantly faster than observed in most of the available lipid models~\cite{javanainen17}. Sodium cations exhibit an even a more rapid exchange. This all suggests that simulations with a length of several hundreds of nanoseconds are sufficient to simulate ion binding to phospholipid bilayers in equilibrium when realistic force fields are used. This has not been the case with previous lipid force fields, which overestimate the binding strength of the sodium and calcium cations \cite{javanainen17, catte16}.
%Such a finding changes the point of view on binding of calcium to PC membranes from
%a very strong long-term stable binding with rare exchanges to 
%a relatively frequent exchange of clacium cations 
%in equilibrium between membrane and solvent. 




\section{Conclusions}

In this study, we employed the electrometer concept to demonstrate that the binding of \ce{Na^+} and \ce{Ca^2+} ions
to a POPC lipid bilayer can be accurately described within a classical MD simulation 
force field, provided that electronic polarization is implicitly included via 
the electronic continuum correction~\cite{leontyev11}.
While the structural details of a POPC lipid bilayer simulated with the newly developed ECC-lipids
model agree with experiments with an accuracy comparable to the other state of the art lipid models,
the model also reproduces the experimental lipid head group order parameter responses to
a cationic surfactant, NaCl and CaCl$_2$ concentrations. 
It thus represents a significant improvement over 
other available lipid models, which overestimate cation binding affinities~\cite{catte16}.  
The ECC-lipids model is build upon
the Lipid14 POPC model~\cite{dickson14} by scaling the partial charges by a factor of 0.8
and reducing the Van der Waals radii by a factor of 0.89 for the headgroup, glycerol backbone and carbonyl atoms. 

The good agreement with experiments enables us to 
interpret NMR experiments with atomistic details using MD simulations with the ECC-lipid model.
In line with previous interpretations of experimental data \cite{hauser76,hauser78,herbette84,binder02},
Ca$^{2+}$ ions interact mainly with phosphate oxygens.
However, the stoichiometry of calcium binding is significantly more complicated than
the simple ternary complex model, used to interpret NMR data, where one calcium binds to two POPC molecules~\cite{altenbach84}.
While complexes with one calcium ion bound to two lipids are the most probable also in the
ECC-lipids model, complexes of one or three lipids per one calcium
were observed to relatively abundant and also almost equally likely. While the success of the simple ternary
compex model in fitting NMR data is understandable based on the simulation results,
it cannot capture the complex nature of calcium binding to phospholipid bilayers
oberved in the present simulation.

Accurate description of cation binding to POPC bilayer paves the way for
simulations of complex biochemical systems at cellular membranes with realistically described
electrostatic interactions. To this end, the compatibility of
the ECC-lipids model with existing models for proteins and other biological molecules should to be verified and, if necessary, 
further adjustments along the ECC concept in force fields of molecules interacting with the lipids need to be done.

%but we expect that the correction can be used also for other lipids
%and force fields.

%We suggest using state of the art water models like OPC3\cite{Izadi16} or OPC \cite{Izadi14},
%which yield higher accuracy than the traditional TIP3p water model~\cite{jorgensen83}.
%Several water models 
%(OPC3\cite{Izadi16}, OPC \cite{Izadi14}, SPC/E \cite{Berendsen1987} and TIP4p/2005 \cite{Abascal2005}) 
%were used to exemplify the transferability of 
%the parameters of the new ECC-lipids force field.

{\bf SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION}
\end{center}

It was found in the original work~\cite{altenbach84} that 
a ternary complex binding model (i.e.~2~POPC:1~\ce{Ca^{2+}})
provides the best fit to experimental measurements of all considered models in that study. 
In such a model, there is a linear relationship between quantities 
$C_b$, mole fraction of bound \ce{Ca^{2+}} per POPC, and $\sqrt{C_b/C_I}$, 
where $C_I$ is the concentration of free cations at the plane of ion binding~\cite{altenbach84}.
The concentration $C_b$ was obtained from an extrapolation of linear relation 
between deuterium NMR measurements and atomic absorption spectroscopy for low concetrations of \ce{CaCl2}.
Such an extrapolation is valid as long as the mode of \ce{Ca^{2+}} binding 
remains constant throughout the extrapolation range. 
The concentration $C_I$ is determined from the surface potential using the Boltzmann equation.
However, Boltzmann theory yields inaccurate results
for divalent cations like \ce{Ca^{2+}}~\cite{Andelman1995}. 
An atomistic simulation, on the other hand, provides these quantities directly without severe assumptions;
$C_b$ can be calculated from simulation using the robust definition in section~\ref{sec:affinity},
and $C_I$ can be obtained from the density profiles in Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl-density} 
as the minimum concentration at the shallow depression separating the bulk water phase 
and the peak of adsorbed cations around 2.6\,nm from the membrene centre. 
The small discrepancy between the results in the experiment~\cite{altenbach84} and 
our simulations are likely caused by the difference in the evaluation of the concentrations.

    Ternary complex binding model of \ce{Ca^{2+}} to a POPC membrane 
    that assumes the stoichiometry of 2~POPC:1~\ce{Ca^{2+}} (details in reference~\citenum{altenbach84}) 
    provides a good fit to experimental measurements~\cite{altenbach84}
    and it also provides a good fit to our simulation data. 
    This supports our statement that the success of the ternary complex model in the experiments
    can be understood with the atomistic detail of our simulations as an average 
    stoichiometry of otherwise almost evenly distributed clusters of one cation with 1,2 or 3 lipids (Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl_complexes}). 
    Note that the units in the reference~\citenum{altenbach84} are different from the units presented here,
    and, hence, the observed slope of the linear relationship is slightly different.

   Histograms of residence times of \ce{Ca^{2+}} in a POPC bilayer 
   at $450\,\mathrm{mM}$ concentration of \ce{CaCl_2} in water before adsorption to phospholipids
   from simulations with ECC-lipids/ECC-ions (top)
   and CHARMM36/ECC-ions (bottom), which was taken from previous study \cite{javanainen17} 
   (simulation data available at Ref.~\citenum{zenodo.259376}).
   The maxima on the x-axis represent the lengths of the simulations used for analysis. 
   For the ECC-lipids model, 90\% of the residence times of \ce{Ca^{2+}} in a POPC membrane are 
   shorter than $60\,\mathrm{ns}$, % exactly $53\,\mathrm{ns}$
   with the longest observed residence time being $141\,\mathrm{ns}$, 
   which is well below the total length of the simulation (200~ns).
   This is, however not true for the simulation with CHARMM36 model,
   where there are several calcium cations with their residence time 
   apparently limited by the length of the simulation. 
   With such a simulation, which is relatively short for the employed model,
   we can merely estimate an upper bound that 
   only less than 60\% of the bound residence time 
   is formed by cations interacting with the phospholipid membrane 
   for less then half of the simulation length~(400~ns).
