GROMACS:      gmx mdrun, VERSION 5.1.4
Executable:   /home/melcr/prog/BIN/gromacs/gromacs-5.1.4+plumed2.2.3/intel_13.1.0.146-tmpi_avx256/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /home/melcr/prog/BIN/gromacs/gromacs-5.1.4+plumed2.2.3/intel_13.1.0.146-tmpi_avx256
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -x /scratch/melcr/sim20_big-160558/traj_comp.xtc -tunepme -pin on


Back Off! I just backed up md.log to ./#md.log.1#

Running on 1 node with total 16 cores, 16 logical cores, 2 compatible GPUs
Hardware detected:
  CPU info:
    Vendor: GenuineIntel
    Brand:  Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2630 v3 @ 2.40GHz
    SIMD instructions most likely to fit this hardware: AVX2_256
    SIMD instructions selected at GROMACS compile time: AVX_256
  GPU info:
    Number of GPUs detected: 2
    #0: NVIDIA Tesla K40m, compute cap.: 3.5, ECC: yes, stat: compatible
    #1: NVIDIA Tesla K40m, compute cap.: 3.5, ECC: yes, stat: compatible

Compiled SIMD instructions: AVX_256, GROMACS could use AVX2_256 on this machine, which is better

Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 5.1.4 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 25 to 40, rlist from 1.016 to 1.053

The number of OpenMP threads was set by environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS to 8
Using 4 MPI threads
Using 8 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread


WARNING: Oversubscribing the available 16 logical CPU cores with 32 threads.
         This will cause considerable performance loss!
2 compatible GPUs are present, with IDs 0,1
2 GPUs auto-selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 4 PP ranks in this node: 0,0,1,1


NOTE: GROMACS was configured without NVML support hence it can not exploit
      application clocks of the detected Tesla K40m GPU to improve performance.
      Recompile with the NVML library (compatible with the driver used) or set application clocks manually.

Back Off! I just backed up /scratch/melcr/sim20_big-160558/traj_comp.xtc to /scratch/melcr/sim20_big-160558/#traj_comp.xtc.1#

Back Off! I just backed up ener.edr to ./#ener.edr.1#

WARNING: This run will generate roughly 2669 Mb of data


NOTE: DLB will not turn on during the first phase of PME tuning

starting mdrun '128 POPC in 4-site water'
150000000 steps, 300000.0 ps.

NOTE: DLB can now turn on, when beneficial


NOTE: Turning on dynamic load balancing


Writing final coordinates.

Back Off! I just backed up confout.gro to ./#confout.gro.1#

 Average load imbalance: 10.0 %
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 2.1 %
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 1 %
